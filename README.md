## Introduction

Causality-Copilot is a LLM-oriented toolkit for **automatic causal discovery**, aiming to help researchers and data scientists identify causal relationships within real-world datasets. Given the data, Causality Copilot autonomously selects the best-suited causal discovery algorithm, sets up proper hyper-parameters, synthesizes the code for execution, and finally generates the easy-to-read PDF report to users.

## Features

- **Automated Causal Discovery**: Carefully designed prompts guide LLMs to use causal discovery algorithms and identify causal relationships, without human involvement and extensive parameter tuning.
- **User-friendly Visualization**: Clearly represent data statistics information, causal graphs and dependencies between variables via easy-to-read figures.
- **Detailed Analysis Report**: Provide well-formulated PDF report for the whole causal discovery process, containing detailed explanation for every step.
- **Extensibility**: Leave interfaces for integrating new causal discovery algorithms and other causality-related libraries.

### Evaluation on Simulated Data

- We evaluate the automatic causal discovery ability of our Causality-Copilot on simulated data, by comparing its performance with a robust baseline using the defaulted settings of PC algorithm.
- The results show that our Causality-Copilot can achieve much better performance, indicating the effectiveness of its automatic algorithm selection and hyper-parameter setting strategy.

| Metric    | Baseline | Causality-Copilot |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Precision | 78.6%    | **81.6%**         |
| Recall    | 78.2%    | **81.0%**         |
| F1-score  | 76.1%    | **79.3%**         |
