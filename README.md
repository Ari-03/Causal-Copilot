## Introduction
Identifying causality lets scientists look past correlations and uncover the mechanisms behind natural and social phenomena. Although many advanced methods for causal discovery now exist, their varied assumptions and technical complexity often discourage non‚Äëexperts from using them.

**Causal‚ÄëCopilot** addresses this gap. Guided by a LLM, it automates the full causal‚Äëanalysis workflow: data inspection, algorithm and hyperparameter selection, code generation, uncertainty assessment, and PDF report creation‚Äî all triggered through simple dialogue. By combining LLM‚Äëdriven domain knowledge with state‚Äëof‚Äëthe‚Äëart causal techniques, Causal‚ÄëCopilot lets researchers focus on scientific insight instead of implementation details.

## Features

- **Automated Causal Analysis** ‚Äì An LLM automatically picks and tunes the best causal‚Äëanalysis algorithms, embedding expert heuristics so users need no specialized knowledge.  
- **Statistical¬†+¬†LLM Post‚ÄëProcessing** ‚Äì Performs bootstrap edge‚Äëuncertainty checks and refines the causal graph (pruning, edge re‚Äëdirection) using the LLM‚Äôs prior knowledge.  
- **Chat‚ÄëStyle Interface** ‚Äì Users steer the entire analysis via natural dialogue and receive clear visualizations of data stats and causal graphs‚Äîno technical setup required.  
- **Complete Analysis Report** ‚Äì Outputs a concise PDF that documents methods, shows intuitive visuals, and explains key findings.  
- **Extensible Framework** ‚Äì Open interfaces let developers plug in new causal algorithms or external libraries with minimal effort.

### Architecture Details

- **Causal‚ÄëCopilot** adopts a modular architecture built around five primary components‚Äî**Simulation, User¬†Interaction, Preprocessing, Algorithm¬†Selection,** and **Postprocessing**‚Äîthat together deliver an end‚Äëto‚Äëend causal analysis pipeline. A large language model (LLM) sits at the core of the framework, coordinating data flow among these modules while tapping into auxiliary resources such as a causality‚Äëfocused knowledge base and a library of local algorithms. All modules communicate via unified interfaces that pass structured metadata and intermediate results, allowing the LLM to supervise execution seamlessly. This organization preserves clear separation of concerns, simplifies extension, and makes it straightforward to integrate new capabilities into the system.

- Causal-Copilot integrates over twenty state-of-the-art causal analysis algorithms, broadly categorized into **causal discovery**, **causal inference**, and **auxiliary analysis tools**.

### Autonomous Workflow

- Powered by an integrated LLM, **Causal‚ÄëCopilot** delivers a fully autonomous causal‚Äëanalysis pipeline. A user simply uploads a tabular dataset and a natural‚Äëlanguage query. The LLM‚Äîaugmented by rule‚Äëbased routines‚Äîparses the query, cleans the data, infers variable types, and fills in missing values. It then chooses the best causal method, tunes its hyperparameters, and generates the code to run it. After execution (e.g., producing a causal graph), the LLM checks for inconsistencies, optionally queries the user for clarification, and can chain additional steps‚Äîsuch as effect or counterfactual estimation‚Äîon top of the discovered structure. The system concludes by compiling an interpretable PDF report that summarizes the data, details intermediate choices, and visualizes the final causal results, making the analysis accessible to non‚Äëexperts.

### Evaluation on Simulated Data

- To test Causal‚ÄëCopilot thoroughly, we built a concise yet diverse evaluation suite. Synthetic tabular datasets vary in variable count, graph density, functional form (linear¬†vs.¬†non‚Äëlinear), and noise levels. Synthetic time‚Äëseries data vary in dimensionality, length, lag structure, and noise type. We also create compound benchmarks, e.g., clinical, financial, and IoT scenarios‚Äîthat bundle multiple challenges to mimic real‚Äëworld complexity. Each dataset has a known ground‚Äëtruth graph, allowing us to measure how well the automated pipeline discovers causal structure under a wide range of conditions.
- The results show that our Causal-Copilot can achieve much better performance, indicating the effectiveness of its automatic algorithm selection and hyper-parameter setting strategy, in a autonomous manner.

### Local Deployment

- **Python 3.8+**
- Required Python libraries (specified in `setup/requirements_cpu.txt` and `setup/requirements_gpu.txt`)
- Required LaTeX packages (`tinyTex`)

Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed by choosing the appropriate dependencies (CPU/GPU + Tex):

#### CPU Dependencies

If you don't have a Nvidia GPU, you can't use the GPU accelerated algorithms (e.g. AcceleratedLiNGAM). You can use the CPU version by running:

```bash
pip install -r setup/requirements_cpu.txt --no-deps
```

#### GPU Dependencies

If you have a Nvidia GPU, you can use the GPU accelerated algorithms by running:

```bash
pip install -r setup/requirements_gpu.txt --no-deps
```


### Tex Dependencies

Install the `tinyTex` package to generate PDF reports:

For Mac:

```
$ rm -rf ~/Library/TinyTeX
$ wget -qO- "https://yihui.org/tinytex/install-bin-unix.sh" | sh
$ export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/Library/TinyTeX/bin/universal-darwin" 
$ source ~/.zshrc

$ tlmgr update --self
$ tlmgr install fancyhdr caption subcaption nicefrac microtype lipsum graphics natbib doi

```

For Linux:

```
$ rm -rf ~/.TinyTeX
$ wget -qO- "https://yihui.org/tinytex/install-bin-unix.sh" | sh
$ export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.TinyTeX/bin/x86_64-linux"
$ source ~/.bashrc
