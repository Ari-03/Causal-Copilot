Causal Discovery Report

1. Data Analysis Summary:
   - Data Quality Issues: No missing values found.
   - Statistical Properties: The data is not linear, and errors are not Gaussian.
   - Potential Causal Relationships: There is a strong direct causal relationship between the Richter scale and deaths, influenced by region and area.
   - Domain-Specific Considerations: Infrastructure resilience and preparedness are crucial in interpreting the data.

2. Algorithm Selection Rationale:
   - We selected Bayesian networks for their ability to model complex relationships and handle uncertainties effectively, with specific comparisons to alternative methods such as linear regression which failed to capture non-linear relationships.

3. Causal Discovery Results:
   - Findings indicate a robust causal structure, with high confidence intervals observed in critical regions; visual representations will be included in the final PDF.

4. Interpretation and Implications:
   - Examples will be drawn from recent earthquake data where preparedness level was clearly linked to minimized fatality rates, illustrating the impact of socio-economic factors.

5. Limitations and Future Work:
   - Limitations include confounding variables such as time of occurrence and variations in infrastructure; future research needs to validate these findings across broader datasets.

Next steps will involve converting this content to a PDF and including visual graphs based on the causal analysis.
