## Results Summary
Include the following sentenses and graphs in the report:
The following are result graphs produced by our algorithm.
The initial graph is the graph in the first attempt, and the revised graph is the one pruned with bootstrapping and LLM suggestion.

### Graph Reliability Analysis
Based on the confidence probability heatmap and background knowledge, we can analyze the reliability of our graph.

[RELIABILITY_ANALYSIS]

### Metrics Evaluation
There are two dictionaries containing values of metrics: SHD (Structural Hamming Distance), precision, Recall, and f1 score.
This is the value for the original graph:[RESULT_METRICS1]
This is the value for the revised graph:[RESULT_METRICS2]

Also include this graph:
![Metric Graph]([RESULT_GRAPH3])
Please convert it into a table to compare metrics of original and revised graph, include it in the report, and give some simple analysis.
