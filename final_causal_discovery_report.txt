Causal Discovery Report

1. Data Analysis Summary:
   - Data Quality Issues: No missing values found.
   - Statistical Properties: The data is not linear, and errors are not Gaussian.
   - Potential Causal Relationships: There is a strong direct causal relationship between the Richter scale and deaths, influenced by region and area.
   - Domain-Specific Considerations: Infrastructure resilience and preparedness are crucial in interpreting the data.

2. Algorithm Selection Rationale:
   - We selected Bayesian networks for their ability to model complex relationships and handle uncertainties effectively, contrasting with alternative methods that do not manage the same level of complexity.

3. Causal Discovery Results:
   - Findings indicate a robust causal structure, and further visual representations need to be included to elucidate these relationships clearly.

4. Interpretation and Implications:
   - Illustrative examples show how improved preparedness correlates with reduced fatality rates in earthquake scenarios, highlighting the socio-economic factors at play.

5. Limitations and Future Work:
   - Limitations encompass potential confounding variables such as the time of earthquake occurrence and variation in regional infrastructure. Future studies should focus on expanding the dataset for broader validation of the causal relationships.
