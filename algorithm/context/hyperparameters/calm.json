  "algorithm_name": "CALM",
  "lambda1": {
    "meaning": "Coefficient for the L0 penalty, which encourages sparsity in the learned graph",
    "suggested_values": {
      "default": 0.005,
      "sparse_graph": 0.01,
      "dense_graph": 0.001
    },
    "reasoning": "Controls the sparsity of the learned graph. Higher values lead to sparser graphs. Use larger values for sparse graphs and smaller values for dense graphs."
  },
  "alpha": {
    "meaning": "Significance level for moral graph estimation using IAMB",
    "suggested_values": {
      "default": 0.01,
      "small_sample": 0.05,
      "large_sample": 0.001
    },
    "reasoning": "Controls the significance level for independence tests in moral graph estimation. Use larger values for small samples to avoid missing edges, and smaller values for large samples to maintain precision."
  },
  "tau": {
    "meaning": "Temperature parameter for the Gumbel-Sigmoid approximation",
    "suggested_values": {
      "default": 0.5,
      "high_precision": 0.2,
      "high_recall": 0.8
    },
    "reasoning": "Controls the sharpness of the Gumbel-Sigmoid approximation. Lower values make it closer to a hard threshold but may make optimization harder."
  },
  "rho_init": {
    "meaning": "Initial value of the penalty parameter for the acyclicity constraint",
    "suggested_values": {
      "default": 1e-5,
      "small_graph": 1e-4,
      "large_graph": 1e-6
    },
    "reasoning": "Starting value for the penalty parameter in the quadratic penalty method. Should be small enough to allow initial exploration but not too small to slow convergence."
  },
  "rho_mult": {
    "meaning": "Multiplication factor for increasing rho in each iteration",
    "suggested_values": {
      "default": 3,
      "aggressive": 5,
      "conservative": 2
    },
    "reasoning": "Controls how quickly the penalty parameter increases. Larger values lead to faster convergence but may miss better solutions."
  },
  "standardize": {
    "meaning": "Whether to standardize the input data",
    "suggested_values": {
      "default": true,
      "no_standardization": false
    },
    "reasoning": "Standardization is recommended in most cases as it helps with numerical stability and improves performance. Only set to false if there's a specific reason to preserve the original scale."
