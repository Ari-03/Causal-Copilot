        "meaning": "Lookback window length for the time-lagged causal relations",

      "meaning": "lambdas for convolutional parameters in each time step. In the order of ..., lag2, lag1, instantaneous. E.g. [0.02, 0.01]",

      "meaning": "list of w_thresholds for convolutional parameters in each time step",
      "suggested_values": [5, 7, 2],
