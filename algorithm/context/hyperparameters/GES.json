    "reasoning": "Use 'local_score_BIC' for a good balance of fit and complexity for linear data. 'BDeu' for discrete data. 'marginal_general' and 'marginal_multi' are powerful for complex data such as nonlinear data but time-consuming. 'marginal_general' leverages non-parametric generalized score and cross-validation to select the best model. 'marginal_multi' leverages non-parametric generalized score and marginal likelihood to select the best model."

    },
    "reasoning": "For graphs with <10 nodes, use null (no limit) to explore all possibilities. For 10-25 nodes, limit maxP to 3. For 25-50 nodes, use maxP=5. For >50 nodes, use maxP=7 to reduce computational complexity. Each additional parent can increase runtime exponentially."
