'BDeu' for discrete data. local_score_marginal_general and marginal_multi are powerful for complex data such as nonlinear data but time-consuming. local_score_marginal_general leverages non-parametric generalized score and cross-validation to select the best model. local_score_marginal_multi leverages non-parametric generalized score and marginal likelihood to select the best model. Note [IMPORTANT]: local_score_marginal_general and local_score_marginal_multi are extremely slow. Only consider local_score_marginal_general if the variable size is less than 5. Do not consider local_score_marginal_multi since it is buggy now."

For graphs with <10 nodes, use depth 5; for graphs with 10-25 nodes, use depth 3; for graphs with >25 nodes, use depth 2 to maintain reasonable runtime. Each unit increase in depth can increase runtime exponentially."
