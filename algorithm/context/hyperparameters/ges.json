    "reasoning": "Use 'local_score_BIC' for a good balance of fit and complexity for linear data. 'BDeu' for discrete data. local_score_marginal_general and marginal_multi are powerful for complex data such as nonlinear data but time-consuming. local_score_marginal_general leverages non-parametric generalized score and cross-validation to select the best model. local_score_marginal_multi leverages non-parametric generalized score and marginal likelihood to select the best model."
