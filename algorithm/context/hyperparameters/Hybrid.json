    "meaning": "The algorithm to use in the first stage for learning the initial CPDAG",

      "default": "pc",
      "effective": "ges",
      "efficient": "pc"
    },
    "reasoning": "Use 'pc' for general cases and high-dimensional data due to its efficiency. Use 'ges' for slower but better empirical performance."

    "meaning": "The functional model-based method to use for orienting remaining edges",

      "complex_relations": "pnl",
      "skip_second_stage": null
    },
    "reasoning": "Use 'pnl' for complex nonlinear relationships. Use 'anm' for simpler, mostly linear relationships. Set to null to skip second stage orientation."

        "large_sample": 0.01

      "reasoning": "Adjust based on sample size, more conservative (lower) values for larger samples. If < 500, use 0.1; Else if 500-10000 (<10000 but >500), use 0.05; Else if > 10000, using 0.01."

    "reasoning": "Lower values (1) for high-dimensional data or efficiency. Higher values (5) for complex graphs with many confounders. Default (3) balances accuracy and computation."
