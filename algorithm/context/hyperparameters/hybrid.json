    "meaning": "The algorithm to use in the first stage for learning the initial CPDAG",
    "suggested_values": {
      "default": "pc",
      "large_sample": "ges",
      "high_dim": "pc"
    },
    "reasoning": "Use 'pc' for general cases and high-dimensional data due to its efficiency. Use 'ges' for large samples (>10000) when score-based approach is more reliable."

  "second_stage_method": {
    "meaning": "The functional model-based method to use for orienting remaining edges",
    "suggested_values": {
      "default": "pnl",
      "simple_relations": "anm",
      "complex_relations": "pnl",
      "skip_second_stage": null
    },
    "reasoning": "Use 'pnl' for complex nonlinear relationships. Use 'anm' for simpler, mostly linear relationships. Set to null to skip second stage orientation."
  },

    "meaning": "Significance level for both conditional independence and functional model tests",
    "suggested_values": {
      "default": 0.05,
      "small_sample": 0.1,
      "large_sample": 0.01,
      "conservative": 0.001
    },
    "reasoning": "Use higher values (0.1) for small samples (<500) to maintain power. Use lower values (0.01) for large samples (>10000) to control false positives. Use very low values (0.001) when false positives must be minimized."

    "meaning": "Maximum number of potential confounders to consider in functional tests",
    "suggested_values": {
      "default": 3,

    },
    "reasoning": "Lower values (1-2) for high-dimensional data or efficiency. Higher values (4-5) for complex graphs with many confounders. Default (3) balances accuracy and computation."
