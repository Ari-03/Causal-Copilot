Given a dataset with the following properties:

1. Columns: [COLUMNS]
2. Statistics:
   - Data Type: [DATA_TYPE]
   - Missingness: [MISSINGNESS]
   - Linearity: [LINEARITY]
   - Gaussian Error: [GAUSSIAN_ERROR]
   - Stationary: [STATIONARY]

Please analyze the dataset characteristics and recommend suitable causal discovery algorithms. Use the following context information to inform your recommendations:

Algorithms:
[ALGO_CONTEXT]

Score Functions:
[SCORE_FUNCTION_CONTEXT]

Independence Tests:
[INDEPENDENCE_TEST_CONTEXT]

For each recommended algorithm, provide:
1. Algorithm name
2. Brief description
3. Justification for its suitability based on the dataset characteristics
4. Suggested independence test or score function (if applicable)
5. Key hyperparameters to consider

Present your recommendations in a structured JSON format, focusing on the most suitable algorithms given the dataset characteristics. Limit your recommendations to the top 3 most suitable algorithms.

Please structure your response like this example:
