Given the following user query:
[USER_QUERY]

For the data that have the following variables:
[COLUMNS]

And the following statistics:
[STATISTICS_DESC]

All candidate algorithms, their descriptions and tags:
[ALGO_CONTEXT]

Please choose the most suitable causal discovery algorithms up to top [TOP_K], for the data user provided and explain why these algorithms were chosen over the others. For the unselected algorithms, illustrate the reasons for each of them, why we do not choose it.

At the same time, be careful about the current device availability for GPU/CUDA acceleration. Note that some algorithm settings would need GPU to run, which could be a indirect limitation on the algorithm application potential:

[CUDA_WARNING]

[ACCEPT_CPDAG].

Think in-depth and thoroughly step by step. Please include the justifications, the descriptions and finally the selected algorithms in a JSON object. For example:

    {
      "justification": "Explanation of why this algorithm is suitable for the given dataset.",

    },
    {
