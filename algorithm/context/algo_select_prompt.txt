Given the following user query:
[USER_QUERY]

For the data that have the following variables:
[COLUMNS]

And the following statistics:
[STATISTICS_DESC]

All candidate algorithms, their descriptions and tags:
[ALGO_CONTEXT]

Please choose the top [TOP_K] most suitable causal discovery algorithms for the data user provided and explain why these algorithms were chosen over the others.

[CUDA_WARNING]

Think in-depth and thoroughly step by step. Please include the justifications, the descriptions and finally the selected algorithms in a JSON object. For example:

{
  "algorithms": [
    {
      "justification": "Explanation of why this algorithm is suitable for the given dataset.",
      "description": "Brief description of the algorithm.", 
      "name": "Algorithm Name",
    },
    {
      "justification": "Explanation of why this algorithm is suitable for the given dataset.",
      "description": "Brief description of the algorithm.", 
      "name": "Algorithm Name",
    },
    {
      "justification": "Explanation of why this algorithm is suitable for the given dataset.",
      "description": "Brief description of the algorithm.", 
      "name": "Algorithm Name",
    }
  ]
