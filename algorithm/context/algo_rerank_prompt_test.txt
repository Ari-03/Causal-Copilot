# PC

Below is a seven-dimension profile of the PC (Peter–Clark) algorithm, integrating (1) the hyperparameter file, (2) the benchmarking results, and (3) external knowledge about the algorithm and its typical use cases. References or paraphrased remarks from the external sources are indicated where relevant.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. HYPER-PARAMETERS SENSITIVITY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Number of Key Hyperparameters  
  - The PC algorithm has three main hyperparameters:  
    1. α (alpha): Significance level for conditional independence tests.  
    2. indep_test: Choice of conditional independence test (e.g., Fisher’s Z, chi-square, G-square, KCI variants).  
    3. depth: Maximum depth for the skeleton search phase.  

• Tuning Difficulty  
  - α is typically the most critical parameter, with recommended defaults in the provided file (e.g., 0.05 for moderate sample sizes, 0.1 for smaller samples, 0.01 for very large samples). These guidelines simplify tuning for different dataset sizes.  
  - The choice of indep_test can be straightforward (Fisher’s Z for continuous data, chi-square for discrete data, etc.), though advanced options (like KCI) may require more specialized knowledge.  
  - depth has a default of -1 (unlimited), but it can be restricted to reduce runtime for large graphs. The suggested rule of thumb scales with the number of nodes, setting smaller depths for larger graphs.  

• Sensitivity  
  - Small changes in α can produce noticeable effects on edge detection: lower α yields more conservative edge selection (fewer false positives) but may lead to more false negatives.  
  - Shifting from an unlimited depth (depth = -1) to a restricted depth (like 1 to 3) can significantly speed up the search on large graphs but may miss subtler causal relationships.  
  - Changing the independence test (e.g., from a linear Fisher test to a non-parametric test like KCI) can likewise alter both runtime and the ability to capture non-linear causal links.  

• Critique/Extension  
  - Parameters that control graph-search complexity (depth) can drastically reduce runtime but may compromise completeness in highly connected graphs.  
  - The α threshold has more direct influence on statistical testing; even small shifts in α can change the number of edges found. Hence, domain knowledge is often helpful to choose a good α.  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2. ROBUSTNESS & SCALABILITY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Tolerance to Bad Data Quality  
  - Benchmarks (File #2) indicate that PC’s performance tends to degrade when data quality drops (e.g., missing data or measurement error). In fact, PC ranked relatively low in measurement error and missing data tolerance, suggesting it does not handle either type of bad data as robustly as some other methods.  
  - It lacks built-in methods for imputation; in practice, users might preprocess missing values or use more advanced PC variants (e.g., PC-missing).  

• Tolerance to Sparse vs. Dense Connected Systems  
  - PC often performs better on sparse systems, since the number of conditional independence tests remains more manageable. For dense graphs, the algorithm may require many tests, increasing the risk of both false positives and elevated runtime.  
  - From a benchmarking standpoint, when confronted with moderately dense networks, performance declines more in runtime than in accuracy, highlighting the combinatorial explosion of tests in denser graphs.  

• Scalability  
  - According to File #2, the algorithm scored moderately on scalability, reflecting that it can handle dozens to a few hundred variables well, but may slow down noticeably beyond that range.  
  - Parallelization or restricting depth can mitigate the combinatorial explosion in larger problems but may reduce the completeness of causal edges.  

• Critique/Extension  
  - Parallel-PC implementations exist and can be employed on multi-core hardware to improve speed.  
  - Using approximation strategies (like a lower maximum depth or partitioning variables) can be beneficial when the dataset contains hundreds or thousands of variables, though these techniques might weaken correctness guarantees.  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
3. MIXED DATA & COMPLEX FUNCTIONS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Noise Type  
  - The PC algorithm’s traditional setup often presupposes approximately Gaussian errors for continuous data, but other independence tests allow for broader noise distributions.  
  - Benchmarks (File #2) suggested that PC performed somewhat lower when confronted with more diverse or non-Gaussian noise, although advanced tests (KCI, RCIT) can address non-linearity.  

• Mixed Data (Continuous & Discrete)  
  - PC can integrate different conditional independence tests: Fisher’s Z or partial correlation for continuous variables; chi-square or G-square for discrete; or a mix for hybrid data.  
  - Some PC implementations provide direct support for mixed data via specialized tests like G-square, allowing simultaneous handling of continuous and categorical variables.  

• Heterogeneous Data  
  - Benchmark results (File #2) show it scored in the middle ranges under “Heterogeneity.” It can handle moderate changes in distribution across variables, provided a suitable test is chosen.  
  - Marked shifts across subsets of data may require domain-driven adjustments or advanced versions (like FCI for partial latent confounding).  

• Complex Functional Forms  
  - The standard PC algorithm is tailored for linear (or near-linear) dependencies, but employing a kernel-based test (e.g., KCI) can detect non-linear relationships.  
  - Non-linear extensions usually come with higher computational burdens, which can be partially offset by “fastKCI” or “RCIT.”  

• Critique/Extension  
  - Users often underestimate how crucial the independence test choice is when dealing with non-linear patterns. A robust non-parametric test can significantly improve detection of non-linear causal links.  
  - Overfitting concerns can arise in small samples if a highly flexible test is used without proper regularization or multiple testing corrections.  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
4. COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Theoretical Time Complexity  
  - The PC algorithm can have a worst-case time complexity of <temp>[O(n^(k+2))]</temp>, where n is the number of variables and k is the maximum degree of a node in the true graph.  

• Variability in Practical Usage  
  - Despite the polynomial (sometimes high-order) worst-case bound, many real-world graphs are sparse, so runtime is often much lower.  
  - Increasing depth or lowering α can drive up the number of tests, and thus runtime can spike. Conversely, restricting depth dampens the combinatorial explosion but risks missing some edges.  

• Critique/Extension  
  - The worst-case scenario might be rarely encountered in practical sparse settings. However, in denser structures or with large depth parameters, runtime can indeed grow significantly.  
  - Parallelization can help distribute the skeleton-discovery phase across multiple CPUs, improving the typical runtime on large datasets.  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
5. INTERPRETABILITY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Output Format  
  - PC outputs a CPDAG (Completed Partially Directed Acyclic Graph). This graph shows which edges are definitely directed, as well as edges uncertain about orientation.  
  - Some implementations also provide adjacency matrices with confidence measures (e.g., p-values).  

• Strength of the Output Format  
  - CPDAGs are considered quite interpretable: they clarify which directions are inferred and which remain undetermined.  
  - Many software packages (e.g., Tetrad, pcalg) provide visualization tools to help interpret a CPDAG.  

• Limitations of the Output Format  
  - Edges in the “partially” directed region can generate ambiguity, as the algorithm leaves some edges unoriented if the data are insufficiently informative.  
  - In high-dimensional or complex domains, the resulting graph might still be large and cumbersome to interpret without additional domain knowledge.  

• Critique/Extension  
  - Domain experts frequently refine or manually orient ambiguous edges, especially in specialized fields such as genomics or neuroscience.  
  - Some suggest performing a stability or bootstrap analysis to highlight edges that are consistently inferred across subsamples.  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
6. ASSUMPTIONS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Critical Assumptions  
  - Causal Markov condition: Each variable is conditionally independent of its non-descendants, given its parents.  
  - Faithfulness: All and only the conditional independencies in the true structure are reflected in the data.  
  - Causal sufficiency: No unobserved confounders of the measured variables.  
  - Acyclicity: The underlying causal structure forms a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).  

• Violation Impact  
  - Missing confounders can lead to spurious or missing edges.  
  - Unfaithful data-generating mechanisms can hide true edges or create extra independencies.  
  - Feedback loops or cyclic structures break the acyclicity assumption, causing the algorithm to infer incomplete or incorrect edges.  

• Critique/Extension  
  - When hidden variable confounding is suspected, variants like FCI (Fast Causal Inference) or RFCI are recommended instead of basic PC.  
  - Many real-world systems include some feedback or non-stationary behavior, so partial violations are not uncommon. Users often need to test sensitivity or adopt extended algorithms.  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
7. (OPTIONAL) REAL-WORLD BENCHMARKS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Performance on Real Datasets  
  - Across a variety of real datasets (e.g., gene-expression data, brain connectivity data), PC tends to perform competitively for structure learning, provided the data are not extremely noisy or riddled with missing values.  
  - In some evaluations, PC was among the more accurate approaches for sparse graphs but was sometimes outperformed by score-based or hybrid methods on very noisy or dense data.  

• Practical Tips  
  - Combining PC with domain knowledge (e.g., known biological pathways) often yields improved orientation of edges.  
  - Limiting depth can drastically reduce computation time for high-dimensional data, but practitioners must confirm that the trade-off in missed edges is acceptable.  
  - Discussion forums and user groups consistently recommend verifying the sample size is sufficient for the chosen α level, or considering small-sample corrections if data are limited.  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
CONCLUSION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The PC algorithm remains a flagship approach in constraint-based causal discovery, prized for its interpretability (CPDAG output) and relatively direct hyperparameter tuning guidelines (notably α and depth). It is best applied in scenarios where:  
• The graph is not excessively dense.  
• The data generally meet Markov and faithfulness assumptions.  
• There are no severe missing data or measurement error problems, or these issues are pre-processed/handled externally.  
Recent developments in parallelization, alternative independence tests, and specialized PC variants help address non-linearities, mixed data, and large-scale settings. Nonetheless, potential users must keep in mind the algorithm’s sensitivity to significance thresholds, data assumptions, and the combinatorial explosion of conditional tests in bigger or denser networks.────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# PCParallel


────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. HYPER-PARAMETERS SENSITIVITY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Number of Key Hyperparameters  
  - The PC algorithm has three main hyperparameters:  
    1. α (alpha): Significance level for conditional independence tests.  
    2. indep_test: Choice of conditional independence test (e.g., Fisher’s Z, chi-square, G-square).  
    3. cores: Number of CPU cores to be utilized for parallel computation. 
    4. memory_efficient: Boolean variable to use a more memory efficient computation algorithm, tradeoff with running time. 

• Tuning Difficulty  
  - α is typically the most critical parameter, with recommended defaults in the provided file (e.g., 0.05 for moderate sample sizes, 0.1 for smaller samples, 0.01 for very large samples). These guidelines simplify tuning for different dataset sizes.  
  - The choice of indep_test can be straightforward (Fisher’s Z for continuous data, chi-square for discrete data, etc.). Current implementation uses only the mentioned independence tests.
  - cores should ideally be set based on hardware availability (e.g., setting it too high may cause thread contention).
  - memory_efficient mode should only be used for very large datasets with large number of nodes (e.g. number of variables > 2000 and the number of available samples are > 500)

• Sensitivity  
  - Small changes in α can produce noticeable effects on edge detection: lower α yields more conservative edge selection (fewer false positives) but may lead to more false negatives.  
  - Using too few threads results in minimal speedup, while excessive parallelization may cause memory bottlenecks.
  - For very large datasets, where memory usage could be an issue, a tradeoff can be made on runtime to utilize the memory more efficiently.

• Critique/Extension  
  - Parallelization improves runtime but does not mitigate statistical limitations (e.g., incorrect edge detection due to faithfulness violations).
  - Performance benefits are hardware-dependent—some systems experience diminishing returns beyond a certain number of threads.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2. ROBUSTNESS & SCALABILITY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Tolerance to Bad Data Quality  
  - Parallel-PC inherits PC’s lack of built-in missing data handling.
  - Errors in CI tests are not corrected by parallelization, meaning missing or noisy data still degrade performance. 

• Tolerance to Sparse vs. Dense Connected Systems  
  - Parallelization helps in denser graphs, where the number of CI tests grows combinatorially.
  - Benchmarks suggest speed gains of up to 10× on dense networks, but correctness depends on CI test quality.

• Scalability  
  - Can handle higher-dimensional problems than standard PC.
  - Linear scalability up to a certain number of cores (12-14), after which performance gains diminish due to memory overhead.

• Critique/Extension  
  - Unlike the standard PC, Parallel-PC is explicitly designed for large graphs.
  - Despite parallelism, datasets with thousands of variables may still require heuristic modifications like early stopping or approximate skeleton pruning.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
4. COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Theoretical Time Complexity  
  - The worst-case complexity of PC is <temp>[O(n^(k+2))]</temp>, parallelization does not change this, but distributes the workload to achieve better practical runtime.

• Variability in Practical Usage  
  - On modern multi-core CPUs, speed improvements scale well up to 16–32 cores, after which performance gains saturate.
  - memory_efficient mode can be deployed for very large datasets, trading off some runtime over memory consumption. 

• Critique/Extension  
  - Parallelization does not reduce worst-case complexity, but makes real-world execution feasible for larger graphs.
  - Works best when CPU utilization is optimized—thread scheduling inefficiencies can arise with suboptimal configurations.

7. (OPTIONAL) REAL-WORLD BENCHMARKS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Performance on Real Datasets  
  - Parallel-PC demonstrates significantly better runtime than standard PC, with similar accuracy. Gains are most prominent in high-dimensional datasets, where speedup factors of 5× to 10× are common.
  - Since Parallel-PC implements the PC-stable version of the algorithm, the performance will be similar if not better than traditional PC. 

• Practical Tips  
  - Combining PC with domain knowledge (e.g., known biological pathways) often yields improved orientation of edges.  
  - Ensure correct number of cores—too many parallel cores may cause contention.
  - Discussion forums and user groups consistently recommend verifying the sample size is sufficient for the chosen α level, or considering small-sample corrections if data are limited.  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
CONCLUSION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Parallel-PC retains the interpretability and theoretical foundations of the standard PC algorithm while significantly improving scalability and runtime through parallelization of CI tests. The key benefits include:
 • Faster execution on multi-core CPUs.
 • Better handling of large graphs, particularly dense structures.
 • Maintains correctness guarantees from PC, but does not solve its statistical limitations.
However, Parallel-PC still faces similar challenges to standard PC, such as:
 • High sensitivity to significance thresholds (α).
 • Limited robustness to missing data and confounding.
 • No explicit handling of cyclic or feedback systems.

# FCI

Below is a comprehensive profile of the Fast Causal Inference (FCI) algorithm, structured according to the seven “degrees” (dimensions) of analysis. This profile synthesizes:  
• File #1 (the hyperparameter settings),  
• File #2 (benchmarking results),  
• External knowledge about FCI (including peer-reviewed papers, publicly available documentation, and community discussions),  
• General principles of causal discovery.  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Hyper-Parameters Sensitivity
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

• Number of Key Hyperparameters  
  – FCI has three principal hyperparameters (based on File #1):  
    1) α (significance level),  
    2) The choice of independence test (indep_test),  
    3) The depth parameter controlling how exhaustively conditional independence tests are performed.  

• Tuning Difficulty  
  – α (significance level) is among the most impactful parameters. Its default is often 0.05, though File #1 suggests using 0.1 for very small samples (< 500), 0.05 for moderate-sized samples (500 to 10,000), and 0.01 for extremely large samples (> 10,000).  
  – The independence test parameter (indep_test) depends on data type and modeling assumptions. Commonly used options in practice include:  
     “fisherz” for continuous data under a Gaussian assumption,  
     “chisq” for discrete data,  
     “gsq,” “kci,” or “rcit” for more general or non-linear data.  
  – Depth settings can be unrestricted (-1) or limited to reduce computation. While the defaults are straightforward (e.g., unlimited depth for small graphs), tuning ultimately depends on computational constraints and how dense the graph might be.  

• Sensitivity  
  – α: Small changes (e.g., from 0.05 to 0.01) can sharply reduce false positives but potentially increase false negatives. Benchmarks in File #2 indicate that performance metrics (e.g., adjacency precision) shift when α is made more conservative.  
  – Depth: Restricting depth can speed up the skeleton discovery step considerably but risks missing some indirect connections, as fewer conditional sets are tested.  

• Critique/Extension  
  – Parameters that control search complexity (e.g., depth) heavily influence runtime, particularly on large or dense graphs.  
  – Parameters controlling statistical tests (e.g., α and the independence test selection) most directly affect the quality of the discovered causal structure (false positives / false negatives in edges).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2. Robustness & Scalability
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

• Tolerance to Bad Data Quality  
  – Missing Data: FCI can tolerate missing data if the chosen independence test supports it (e.g., some tests impute or ignore missing cases). Benchmarks in File #2 show FCI performing around a moderate level (neither the best nor the worst) when data are missing.  
  – Measurement/Observation Error: FCI’s performance decreases with severe noise but remains relatively stable for moderate noise levels. Its ability to discover latent structures can mitigate some confounding effects of measurement error, though the precision of edges can drop if noise is extreme.  

• Tolerance to Sparse/Dense Connected Systems  
  – Sparse Networks: FCI typically performs well in sparse graphs, because fewer edges mean fewer complex conditional independence tests.  
  – Dense Networks: FCI can handle denser connectivity but at notably increased computational cost, as more conditional tests are required and orienting edges becomes more complex.  

• Scalability  
  – As the number of variables grows, the number of required conditional independence tests can explode. File #2 reports an above-average computational burden for FCI once the variable count is large.  
  – FCI can still be applied to moderately high-dimensional data, but runtime may become prohibitive without restricting the depth parameter or using parallelization strategies.  

• Critique/Extension  
  – Parallel Implementation: Some implementations offer parallelized independence testing to help with large datasets.  
  – Approximate or Bounded Depth: Restricting the maximum depth of search is a common strategy to reduce runtime (though this may sacrifice some accuracy).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
3. Mixed Data & Complex Functions
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

• Noise Type  
  – FCI itself does not strictly require Gaussian noise; it simply needs an appropriate conditional independence test (e.g., “kci” or “rcit” from File #1) to detect non-linear, non-Gaussian dependencies.  

• Mixed Data (Continuous & Discrete)  
  – Users can choose independence tests suited to mixed data (e.g., “gsq”) or generalized tests that handle a variety of variable types. According to File #1, “kci,” “fastkci,” and “rcit” may also address nonlinear interactions across data types.  

• Heterogeneous Data  
  – File #2 suggests moderate performance under heterogeneous conditions (e.g., data collected from different sources or distributions). FCI’s separation-of-independences approach can still work if independence tests remain valid across distributions.  

• Complex Functional Forms  
  – Non-linear relationships are detectable if the chosen independence test can pick them up. FCI, however, does not automatically model these relationships; it relies on test outcomes.  

• Critique/Extension  
  – The primary limitation is reliance on an accurate independence test. If the test poorly captures non-linear or complex interactions, FCI may miss true edges or introduce extraneous ones.  
  – Some advanced versions of FCI or user-developed variations incorporate kernel-based tests, enabling more robust detection of complicated functional relationships.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
4. Computational Complexity
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

• Theoretical Time Complexity  
  – FCI is often cited as having an exponential worst-case time complexity with respect to the number of variables. A simplified expression is presented here: <temp>[O(2^n)]</temp>.  
  – In practice, the real cost is heavily influenced by how many adjacency constraints it identifies early in the process.

• Variability in Practical Usage  
  – Depth-limited FCI can reduce runtime to something more manageable (potentially polynomial in many real-world scenarios).  
  – Higher significance levels (larger α) may reduce the total number of conditional independence tests because edges are removed more slowly, but they risk more spurious edges that must be tested and oriented later.  

• Critique/Extension  
  – The worst-case complexity is rarely reached in sparse, real-world networks.  
  – Parallel computing and caching of test results (mentioned in community forums) can improve runtime substantially.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
5. Interpretability
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

• Output Format  
  – FCI outputs a Partial Ancestral Graph (PAG), which represents causal constraints among variables, including potential latent confounders.  

• Strength of the Output Format  
  – PAGs explicitly encode uncertain edges (e.g., bidirected edges indicating hidden confounders, circle endpoints indicating ambiguous directions). This offers rich information about causal possibilities.  

• Limitations of the Output Format  
  – PAGs can be less intuitive than DAGs or CPDAGs. Edges may remain unoriented or partially oriented, especially if data alone cannot resolve their direction.  
  – Users often require additional domain knowledge to interpret or further refine certain ambiguous edges.  

• Critique/Extension  
  – Researchers recommend domain experts consult the PAG’s edge marks to hypothesize plausible latent variables or refine uncertain orientations.  
  – Visualization libraries for FCI exist but require a solid grasp of the edge nomenclature.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
6. Assumptions
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

• Critical Assumptions  
  – Markov and Faithfulness: The distribution of the data must align with the “true” causal graph’s conditional independencies, without pathological cancellations.  
  – No Cycles: FCI assumes acyclicity among observed variables, even though it allows for the possibility of latent confounders.  
  – Causal Sufficiency is relaxed compared to simpler algorithms (like PC), meaning FCI can account for possible hidden variables.  

• Violation Impact  
  – Violating faithfulness can produce incomplete or misleading PAGs (e.g., missing edges or unvalued circle endpoints).  
  – When hidden confounding is extremely strong and the sample size is low, the discovered PAG can have many ambiguities.  

• Critique/Extension  
  – FCI is often chosen because it explicitly relaxes causal sufficiency assumptions. Indeed, that is a main strength over simpler methods.  
  – Partial violations of faithfulness can degrade accuracy but do not necessarily invalidate the overall skeleton of the PAG.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
7. Real-World Benchmarks
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

• Performance on Real Datasets  
  – File #2 indicates that FCI often performs at a middle or upper-middle rank across different metrics (e.g., adjacency precision, sensitivity to hidden variables).  
  – Empirical studies (from external references) report that FCI often outperforms algorithms that assume no latent confounders when hidden variables or selection bias are indeed present.

• Practical Tips  
  – Adjust α based on sample size: Larger samples can justify smaller α for fewer false positives; smaller samples may require a higher α to avoid missing genuine edges.  
  – Parallelizing the conditional independence tests or limiting depth can make FCI more tractable for large-dimensional datasets.  
  – Domain knowledge plays a crucial role in resolving uncertain orientations in the PAG, ensuring the final model is more interpretable and actionable.  

• Common Pitfalls  
  – Using an independence test misaligned with the data’s underlying distribution (e.g., only using Fisher’s Z in the presence of non-linear or discrete variables) can lead to incorrect edges.  
  – Overly restrictive significance levels with small sample sizes can cause many missed edges, while overly lenient significance levels can flood the output with spurious edges.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Summary
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
FCI (Fast Causal Inference) is a widely respected causal discovery algorithm that relaxes the assumption of no hidden confounders, making it especially valuable when latent variables or selection bias may be present. Its key hyperparameters—significance level (α), independence test choice, and depth constraint—all substantially affect how many edges are retained and how computationally heavy the procedure becomes. Although FCI can handle both continuous and discrete data (and even mixed types) via different independence tests, its runtime grows quickly with the number of variables and the complexity of the network.

Because FCI outputs a Partial Ancestral Graph (PAG), it can reveal potential latent confounding, but this representation may contain uncertain or bidirected edges requiring careful interpretation. This complexity can also make it challenging to tune parameters optimally without domain or statistical expertise. When properly configured, FCI has proven effective in real-world applications like genetics, climate science, and social networks—domains where hidden confounders often lurk. Overall, its flexibility and ability to account for unobserved variables are balanced by higher computational demands and some interpretability challenges relative to simpler methods.────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# FGES

Below is a detailed profile of the Fast Greedy Equivalence Search (FGES) algorithm, organized according to the seven requested dimensions. This profile integrates the provided hyperparameter JSON, benchmarking results, external knowledge, and general expertise on causal discovery methods.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Hyper-Parameters Sensitivity
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

• Number of Key Hyperparameters  
  – From the provided hyperparameter JSON, a primary FGES parameter is “sparsity” (often referred to as the penalty discount factor).  
  – In practice, FGES may include other parameters (e.g., search depth, heuristic speedups, handling of faithfulness) depending on the implementation, but the main one highlighted here is the sparsity/penalty factor.  

• Tuning Difficulty  
  – The “sparsity” parameter (sometimes called penaltyDiscount) typically has a default value (10 in the JSON). This default is often serviceable, giving users a straightforward starting point.  
  – Adjusting it requires some domain knowledge: a high value encourages more edges, potentially uncovering more relationships at the risk of overfitting, whereas a low value enforces stricter parsimony.  
  – Tuning can be guided by domain experts or automated methods (e.g., cross-validation). In simpler cases, a general-purpose LLM or heuristic search can also help explore plausible values.  

• Sensitivity to Changes  
  – Small shifts around the default (e.g., from 10 to 8 or 12) may mildly alter the number of discovered edges. However, larger swings (e.g., from 10 down to 2, or up to 20+) can drastically change both the runtime and the number of inferred causal connections.  
  – According to the benchmarking data, FGES can show moderate variability in performance under different parameter configurations, but it remains relatively stable if parameters are tuned within a sensible range.  

• Critique/Extension  
  – Parameters affecting search complexity (e.g., if search depth or heuristic flags were exposed) directly impact runtime and how exhaustively FGES explores the graph space.  
  – The sparsity parameter more directly influences the scoring function’s trade-off between model complexity and fit.  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2. Robustness & Scalability
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

• Tolerance to Bad Data Quality  
  – Missing Data: The benchmark summary suggests FGES does not rank strongly under high rates of missing data. It can still run, but performance typically drops if the user does not employ external imputation or specialized handling.  
  – Measurement/Observation Error: FGES appears moderately tolerant to mild noise but sensitive to high levels of measurement error. The benchmarking data (“Measurement Error” category) indicates it tends to be at an intermediate or lower tier of performance when error rates soar.  

• Tolerance to Sparse/Dense Connected Systems  
  – FGES often excels in relatively sparse networks, as the scoring-based approach efficiently prunes edges. For highly dense or complex graphs, performance can still be good but may require more careful parameter tuning and more computational time.  
  – Benchmark trends show FGES doesn’t sharply degrade in moderately dense networks, though extremely dense structures may slow the search.  

• Scalability  
  – FGES is praised for its ability to scale to thousands of variables, particularly when the underlying data-generating graph is not overly dense.  
  – In practice, the provided benchmarks indicate FGES’s efficiency is in a middle-to-favorable range compared to other algorithms, but once the number of variables grows very large, ensuring sufficient computational resources (CPU cores, memory) becomes essential.  

• Critique/Extension  
  – FGES can often be parallelized, which significantly reduces runtime on multi-core machines.  
  – For extremely large datasets with many variables, users sometimes employ approximate or heuristic versions of FGES that prune edges early or limit search depth.  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
3. Mixed Data & Complex Functions
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

• Noise Type  
  – Classic FGES implementations generally assume Gaussian noise for continuous variables. This assumption can be robust for moderate noise, but extremely non-Gaussian distributions may reduce accuracy unless specialized tests or scores are integrated.  

• Mixed Data (Continuous & Discrete)  
  – Standard FGES variants typically handle continuous or discrete data (with separate scoring functions such as BIC on Gaussians vs. BDeu on discrete). Some libraries provide a “mixed” scoring approach, though it may require advanced configuration.  
  – Users aiming to combine continuous and discrete variables sometimes turn to specialized FGES extensions that adapt the scoring function accordingly.  

• Heterogeneous Data  
  – According to the benchmarks (“Heterogeneity” category), FGES maintains moderate performance and efficiency across varying data sources, as long as users consistently handle or merge the data into a single table.  
  – Distribution shifts across datasets may require caution, since FGES typically assumes a single underlying causal structure for the entire dataset.  

• Complex Functional Forms  
  – Out of the box, standard FGES is most comfortable with linear relationships. Strongly nonlinear causal links might be approximated but not perfectly captured by linear or discrete scoring.  
  – Community forums suggest users sometimes replace the default scoring function with a more flexible or nonparametric alternative, though that is not always plug-and-play.  

• Critique/Extension  
  – When confronted with significantly nonlinear phenomena, adding domain knowledge or using extended FGES variants (e.g., kernel-based independence tests) may be advisable.  
  – Overfitting can occur if the search is too permissive, especially under a high penalty discount (low sparsity).  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
4. Computational Complexity
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

• Theoretical Time Complexity  
  – Commonly cited as <temp>[O(p^2 × n_log(n))]</temp> or a similar polynomial function, depending on implementation. Exact expressions vary, but many references describe FGES as roughly quadratic in the number of variables (p), with additional factors for sample size (n) and repeated scoring.  
  – The provided external information indicates FGES has proven feasible on extremely large datasets, although the worst-case complexity can still be high if numerous potential edges are retained.  

• Variability in Practical Usage  
  – Search constraints (e.g., limiting maximum parent set size or search depth) can drastically cut computational cost.  
  – Parallelization further reduces wall-clock time, a recommended approach if the dataset is large.  

• Critique/Extension  
  – Worst-case run times can be higher than typical usage if the number of edges tested is very high and no speedups are employed.  
  – Heuristic speedups, especially early-edge pruning, can bring the practical runtime closer to manageable levels for large-scale data.  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
5. Interpretability
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

• Output Format  
  – FGES typically produces a partially directed acyclic graph (PDAG) or CPDAG, in which some edges are oriented while others may remain ambiguous (undirected).  
  – Users can also convert this to adjacency matrices with confidence scores if the software supports scoring edges in detail.  

• Strength of the Output Format  
  – Graphical outputs (via adjacency lists or GraphML file formats) are generally intuitive for domain experts, making it easier to visualize and discuss potential causal paths.  

• Limitations of the Output Format  
  – FGES often leaves certain edges undirected if the direction is not definitively supported by statistical evidence.  
  – Confidence intervals or p-values for edges may not be directly reported in certain toolkits; users wanting uncertainty measures sometimes need additional bootstrap or resampling procedures.  

• Critique/Extension  
  – Post-processing or domain knowledge can help orient ambiguous edges.  
  – Some practitioners supplement FGES outputs with more sophisticated or domain-tailored constraint checks to refine orientation.  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
6. Assumptions
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

• Critical Assumptions  
  – Causal Markov and Faithfulness: The observed independencies are assumed to faithfully represent the underlying causal structure.  
  – Causal Sufficiency: All relevant causes of the variables are measured (i.e., no major hidden confounders).  
  – No Cycles: The true causal structure is assumed to be acyclic.  
  – Data Generation Process: For continuous data, linear-Gaussian relationships are typically assumed unless otherwise modified.  

• Violation Impact  
  – Missing or unmodeled confounders can result in erroneous edge directions or spurious connections.  
  – Strong non-linearities may reduce accuracy if only standard linear scoring is used.  

• Critique/Extension  
  – If hidden confounding is suspected, one might move to FGES variants that allow latent variables (e.g., GFCI).  
  – Moderate violations of faithfulness often lead to small performance drops, but severe violations undercut the reliability of the discovered structure.  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
7. Real-World Benchmarks (Optional)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

• Performance on Real Datasets  
  – In various broad benchmarks, FGES often places in an upper-mid range regarding both speed and structural accuracy.  
  – It has been successfully deployed for high-dimensional tasks in fields like neuroscience and genomics, often producing clearer structures than simpler constraint-based methods when sample sizes are sufficiently large.  

• Practical Tips  
  – Users commonly rely on parallel processing to keep runtime manageable with many variables.  
  – Incorporating domain knowledge (e.g., known biologically relevant pathways in genomics) can help prune the search space and clarify ambiguous edges.  
  – Care must be taken with large or messy real-world data sets containing missingness, as FGES may need explicit data preprocessing.  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Overall Summary
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
FGES is a well-regarded scoring-based causal discovery algorithm that scales efficiently to large numbers of variables, especially in relatively sparse causal networks. Its key “sparsity” (penalty discount) parameter is crucial for balancing graph complexity and model fit, and is relatively straightforward to tune around sensible defaults. FGES’s reliance on linear-Gaussian assumptions (for continuous data) and its assumption of no hidden confounders are important limitations; however, the algorithm’s speed and the clarity of its partially directed graphical outputs make it a popular choice in real-world applications. For best results, users often combine FGES with parallelization techniques, data-cleaning/preprocessing steps, and (when possible) domain knowledge to confirm or refine ambiguously oriented edges.────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# GOLEM

Below is a seven‑part profile of the GOLEM causal discovery algorithm, synthesizing the provided hyperparameter definitions (File #1), benchmarking results (File #2), external information (File #3), and general knowledge of causal discovery methods.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1. Hyper-Parameters Sensitivity
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

• Number of Key Hyperparameters  
  GOLEM, as presented, has three principal hyperparameters:
  1) λ₁ (lambda_1): L1 regularization weight on the adjacency matrix.  
  2) num_iter: The maximum number of iterations in the optimization routine.  
  3) graph_thres: A threshold for pruning edges in the learned adjacency matrix.

• Tuning Difficulty  
  – Default and Suggested Values:  
    The default for λ₁ is 0.01, with sparser or denser graphs encouraged by values 0.1 or 0.001, respectively. num_iter defaults to 10,000 but can be increased if the graph is more complex or if learning non-trivial functional relationships (50,000 to 100,000). graph_thres typically defaults to 0.3 and can be raised (e.g., 0.5) to prune weaker edges or lowered (e.g., 0.1) to keep more edges.  
  – Who Can Tune:  
    In many cases, domain experts or automated tuning approaches (including LLMs) can set these parameters based on practical constraints (e.g., target sparsity level or runtime limits).

• Sensitivity  
  – λ₁ (lambda_1): Even modest changes can shift the discovered structure toward fewer or more edges. In scenarios where λ₁ is too large, important causal links might be pruned. When too small, the algorithm may infer overly dense graphs.  
  – num_iter: Under certain benchmark settings, insufficient iterations can degrade the final structure’s accuracy, while very large values lead to longer runtimes with diminishing returns in performance.  
  – graph_thres: Acts as a final filter for edge selection. A higher threshold can produce fewer edges and reduce false positives, but risks discarding weaker true links.  

• Critique/Extension  
  – Graph-Search vs. Statistical Regularization:  
    λ₁ directly affects the optimization objective and hence the overall graph sparsity, while graph_thres is a simpler post-processing cut-off that can drastically alter the final adjacency matrix. By contrast, num_iter primarily governs how thoroughly the algorithm converges to a solution.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
2. Robustness & Scalability
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

• Tolerance to Bad Data Quality  
  – Missing Data:  
    From the benchmarking results, GOLEM shows a moderate to good composite score when data are partially missing. It can handle missingness reasonably well but may require imputation or a carefully designed data preprocessing step to maintain consistency.  
  – Measurement/Observation Error:  
    The algorithm’s performance metrics under moderate noise are fairly strong, indicating it remains stable. Severe measurement error can still degrade performance, but benchmark evidence suggests it handles such noise at least comparably to other popular methods.

• Tolerance to Sparse/Dense Connected Systems  
  – In extremely sparse networks, a suitably larger λ₁ or higher graph_thres can help reduce false positives.  
  – In denser networks, adopting a smaller λ₁ or lowering graph_thres can uncover more edges, though it may increase runtime and the risk of overfitting.

• Scalability  
  – GOLEM shows decent performance for moderately high-dimensional datasets, but according to one efficiency metric from the benchmarks, it may be less resource-efficient than some competitors.  
  – For extremely large numbers of variables, runtime can spike—especially if num_iter is also set very high. Practitioners often tune these settings or apply warm starts to manage complexity.

• Critique/Extension  
  – Parallelization or Approximation Strategies:  
    While not necessarily built in by default, the gradient-based nature of GOLEM could, in principle, benefit from distributed optimization across multiple cores or machines. Some users combine adjacency-threshold techniques with mini-batch approaches to manage memory usage on very large datasets.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
3. Mixed Data & Complex Functions
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

• Noise Type  
  – Benchmarks suggest GOLEM adapts to various noise distributions (including non-Gaussian), though it may trade off some computational efficiency if the noise is highly non-standard.  
  – A strong “performance” level for noise handling (as shown in the benchmark’s composite rating) indicates it recovers edges reliably even under moderate departures from Gaussian assumptions.

• Mixed Data: Continuous & Discrete  
  – GOLEM is primarily designed for continuous data under a differentiable structural equation modeling framework.  
  – Extensions or custom modifications could handle mixed data, but such usage typically requires specialized modifications to the learning objective or the independence-testing modules.

• Heterogeneous Data  
  – The benchmark results labeled “Heterogeneity” signal that GOLEM can operate with shifts or variations in distributions, scoring relatively high. However, large domain shifts (e.g., drastically different variable scales) may still need careful normalization or weighting schemes.

• Complex Functional Forms  
  – The default GOLEM formulation is well-suited to linear or mildly non-linear relationships. In practice, it can detect non-linearities if the user’s implementation includes appropriate penalty structures or transformations of the variables.  
  – Overfitting concerns arise if one lowers λ₁ too aggressively on small samples, potentially forcing the algorithm to fit intricate but spurious relationships.

• Critique/Extension  
  – Most standard GOLEM implementations target a linear or partly non-linear SEM. For highly non-linear real-world phenomena, domain experts sometimes add non-linear basis expansions or kernels to strengthen the algorithm’s expressiveness.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
4. Computational Complexity
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

• Theoretical Time Complexity  
  A common expression for gradient-based DAG learning like GOLEM may be represented as:  
  <temp>[O(d² · n · α)]</temp>  
  Here, d is the number of variables, n is the sample size, and α captures overhead from iterative optimization. The exact form can vary based on the implementation details and optimization approach.

• Variability in Practical Usage  
  – Increasing num_iter raises computational time proportionally, as more gradient steps are taken.  
  – Larger λ₁ (i.e., stronger regularization) can sometimes lead to faster convergence (fewer edges to optimize), while smaller λ₁ generally requires more fine-grained optimization.

• Critique/Extension  
  – Worst-case scenarios can grow quickly in complexity, albeit typical real-world usage might remain within polynomial time for moderate d.  
  – If employing parallel or GPU-based methods, the practical runtime can be significantly reduced, but naive single-threaded operation may be relatively slow for large d.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
5. Interpretability
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

• Output Format  
  – GOLEM typically returns a weighted adjacency matrix from which the user extracts a directed acyclic graph (DAG) via a threshold step (graph_thres).

• Strength of the Output Format  
  – The adjacency matrix is straightforward to interpret: each cell’s value indicates the discovered influence from one variable to another.  
  – Users often appreciate direct control over the threshold that yields a final binary adjacency.

• Limitations of the Output Format  
  – If the threshold is ill-chosen, important edges might be pruned (or unimportant edges retained).  
  – GOLEM does not inherently provide p-values or confidence intervals; instead, it relies on the optimization landscape dictated by the regularization terms.

• Critique/Extension  
  – Practitioners commonly supplement the adjacency matrix output with domain knowledge or further stability selection techniques (e.g., re-running the algorithm on bootstrapped samples) to increase orientation confidence.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
6. Assumptions
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

• Critical Assumptions  
  – The causal relationships among variables can be represented by a DAG (Markov and faithfulness conditions).  
  – Causal sufficiency: typically assumes no unmeasured confounders.  
  – Errors or noise terms are often treated as independent across variables (though GOLEM can be robust to moderate deviations).

• Violation Impact  
  – If hidden confounders or strong feedback loops exist, performance can deteriorate, leading to mis-specified or partially oriented edges.  
  – When the faithfulness condition is violated (e.g., canceling effects in the data), many causal discovery methods—including GOLEM—may struggle to identify the true structure.

• Critique/Extension  
  – Some implementations incorporate penalty adjustments or domain input for partial confounder correction.  
  – Mild assumption violations often degrade results gradually; severe violations can invalidate critical parts of the inferred graph.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
7. Real-World Benchmarks
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

• Performance on Real Datasets  
  – According to the summary data (File #2), GOLEM has overall mid-to-high scores on a variety of empirical benchmarks involving missing data, measurement noise, and heterogeneous sources. Its performance is typically competitive with other state-of-the-art approaches for structure learning.

• Practical Tips  
  – Users frequently set a moderate λ₁ for typical usage, then refine graph_thres based on domain knowledge of likely causal strengths.  
  – Parallelizing gradient steps or restricting search depth can mitigate runtime overhead on larger datasets.  
  – Overly small λ₁ sometimes leads to denser, less interpretable graphs—so pilot runs and domain insight help optimize hyperparameters for clarity and accuracy.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Overall, GOLEM is a gradient-based causal discovery algorithm that balances regularization with iterative optimization to recover causal structures. It is moderately robust to data imperfections, supports adjustable sparsity (through λ₁ and graph_thres), and can scale to a fair number of variables if tuned properly. Its reliance on standard DAG assumptions is typical in causal discovery, and while it offers a direct adjacency matrix output, users may wish to combine it with domain expertise or post-processing methods to finalize and interpret causal edges.────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
