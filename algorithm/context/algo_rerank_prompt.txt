Based on the above information, please select the best-suited algorithm from the following candidate (the order of the algorithm candidates is not important):

[ALGORITHM_CANDIDATES]

===============================================
Note that the user can only wait for [WAIT_TIME] minutes for the algorithm execution, please ensure the time cost of the selected algorithm would not exceed it!
The estimated time costs of the following algorithms using linear estimation methods (e.g. Fisherz for constraint-based methods, BIC for score-based methods) are below. Use it as a reference for the algorithm runtime comparison, note that the absolute value might changes significantly when the estimation methods are not linear (e.g. KCI for constraint-based methods, Generalized score for score-based methods). Consider the time cost wisely when selecting the algorithm, it is critical but less important than the performance when the time cost does not exceed the waiting time. As long as the timecost difference is not that large [WAIT_TIME], you should pivot more on the performance.

[TIME_INFO]

===============================================
Detailed Profiles of the algorithm candidates are shown here. We also include the supported hyperparamerters as additional information to help you know the potentials of each algorithm combining various hyperparamerter settings. You MUST actively combine and reason with them:

===============================================

Think in-depth and thoroughly step by step. Please include the reasoning process, the ultimate reason why the picked algorithm beats the others and finally the selected algorithm in the JSON format. Cite/Quote quantity/number and references for the evidences of analyzing using one specific algorithm or not. Do not return any other text or comments:
