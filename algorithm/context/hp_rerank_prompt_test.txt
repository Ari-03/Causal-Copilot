Given a dataset with the following properties:

1. Columns: PIP2	Raf	Jnk	Plcg	P38	Akt	Erk	PKA	PKC	PIP3	Mek
2. Statistics:
The dataset has the following characteristics:

Data Type: The overall data type is Continuous.

The sample size is 853 with 11 features. This dataset is not time-series data. Data Quality: There are no missing values in the dataset.

Statistical Properties:
- Linearity: The relationships between variables are not predominantly linear.
- Gaussian Errors: The errors in the data do not follow a Gaussian distribution.
- Heterogeneity: The dataset is not heterogeneous. 





We have selected the following algorithm for causal discovery:

Algorithm: FCI
Description: The FCI (Fast Causal Inference) algorithm is a constraint-based causal discovery method that constructs a CPDAG based on conditional independence information. It is particularly robust in the presence of latent confounders and is suitable for both linear and nonlinear relationships.
FCI is chosen because it strikes the best balance between performance and efficiency, with a proven ability to handle latent variables effectivelyâ€”all critical aspects given the dataset's characteristics and our causal discovery goals.

Now, we need to set up the primary hyperparameters for this algorithm. Please consider the dataset characteristics and the algorithm requirements to suggest appropriate values for the following hyperparameters:

[PRIMARY_HYPERPARAMETERS]

For each primary hyperparameter, provide:
1. The full name of the hyperparameter that is aligned with your understanding ('independence test', 'max depth', 'score function', etc.)
2. The suggested value
3. A brief explanation of why this value is appropriate given the dataset characteristics and algorithm requirements
4. Each primary hyperparameter is provided with a default value, which should be adjusted based on the dataset characteristics and algorithm requirements

Actively use and reason with the following information about each hyperparameter to inform your decisions:

Please provide your suggestions in a structured JSON format. Your response should look like this:

Please always determine the hyperparameters from its corresponding "Suggested Values" part, DO NOT use any values just exist in other context but not in "Suggested Values".

Please consider the trade-offs between accuracy and computational efficiency when suggesting values. If you're unsure about a specific value, you may suggest using the default value and explain why.

Please provide your hyperparameter suggestions following this JSON structure.
