Given a dataset with the following properties:

1. Columns: X1	X2	X3	X4	X5	X6	X7	X8	X9	X10	X11	X12	X13	X14	X15	X16	X17	X18	X19	X20	X21	X22	X23	X24	X25
2. Statistics:
The dataset has the following characteristics:

Data Type: The overall data type is Continuous.

The sample size is 1000 with 25 features. This dataset is not time-series data. Data Quality: There are no missing values in the dataset.

Statistical Properties:
- Linearity: The relationships between variables are predominantly linear.
- Gaussian Errors: The errors in the data do follow a Gaussian distribution.
- Heterogeneity: The dataset is not heterogeneous. 





We have selected the following algorithm for causal discovery:

Algorithm: GOLEM
Description: GOLEM is a continuous-optimization method designed to learn causal structures based on linear relationships efficiently.
GOLEM balances efficiency and performative robustness, significantly adapting to diverse data characteristics while still functioning efficiently within realistic runtime parameters.

Now, we need to set up the primary hyperparameters for this algorithm. Please consider the dataset characteristics and the algorithm requirements to suggest appropriate values for the following hyperparameters:

[PRIMARY_HYPERPARAMETERS]

For each primary hyperparameter, provide:
1. The full name of the hyperparameter that is aligned with your understanding ('independence test', 'max depth', 'score function', etc.)
2. The suggested value
3. A brief explanation of why this value is appropriate given the dataset characteristics and algorithm requirements
4. Each primary hyperparameter is provided with a default value, which should be adjusted based on the dataset characteristics and algorithm requirements

Actively use and reason with the following information about each hyperparameter to inform your decisions:

"{\n  \"algorithm_name\": \"GOLEM\",\n  \"lambda_1\": {\n    \"meaning\": \"L1 regularization parameter for sparsity\",\n    \"suggested_values\": {\n      \"default\": 0.01,\n      \"sparse\": 0.1,\n      \"dense\": 0.001\n    },\n    \"reasoning\": \"Higher values promote sparser graphs, lower values allow more connections.\"\n  },\n  \"num_iter\": {\n    \"meaning\": \"Maximum number of dual ascent steps during optimization\",\n    \"suggested_values\": {\n      \"default\": 10000,\n      \"medium\": 50000,\n      \"thorough\": 100000\n    },\n    \"reasoning\": \"Increase for more complex graphs and functional relationships.\"\n  },\n  \"graph_thres\": {\n    \"meaning\": \"Threshold for edge weights in adjacency matrix\",\n    \"suggested_values\": {\n      \"default\": 0.3,\n      \"conservative\": 0.5,\n      \"liberal\": 0.1\n    },\n    \"reasoning\": \"Higher values lead to sparser graphs by pruning weak connections, which is a kind of implicit sparsity.\"\n  }\n} "

Please provide your suggestions in a structured JSON format. Your response should look like this:

{
  "algorithm": "GOLEM",
  "hyperparameters": {
    "[HYPERPARAMETER_1_NAME]": {
      "full_name": "[HYPERPARAMETER_1_FULL_NAME]",
      "value": [SUGGESTED_VALUE],
      "explanation": "[BRIEF_EXPLANATION]"
    },
    "[HYPERPARAMETER_2_NAME]": {
      "full_name": "[HYPERPARAMETER_2_FULL_NAME]",
      "value": [SUGGESTED_VALUE],
      "explanation": "[BRIEF_EXPLANATION]"
    },
    ...
  }
}

Please always determine the hyperparameters from its corresponding "Suggested Values" part, DO NOT use any values just exist in other context but not in "Suggested Values".

Please consider the trade-offs between accuracy and computational efficiency when suggesting values. If you're unsure about a specific value, you may suggest using the default value and explain why.

Please provide your hyperparameter suggestions following this JSON structure.
