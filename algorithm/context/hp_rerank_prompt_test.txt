Given a dataset with the following properties:

1. Columns: Raf	Mek	Plcg	PIP2	PIP3	Erk	Akt	PKA	PKC	P38	Jnk
2. Statistics:
The dataset has the following characteristics:

Data Type: The overall data type is Continuous.

The sample size is 853 with 11 features. This dataset is not time-series data. Data Quality: There are no missing values in the dataset.

Statistical Properties:
- Linearity: The relationships between variables are predominantly linear.
- Gaussian Errors: The errors in the data do follow a Gaussian distribution.
- Heterogeneity: The dataset is not heterogeneous. 





We have selected the following algorithm for causal discovery:

Algorithm: FGES
Description: FGES (Fast Greedy Equivalence Search) is a score-based causal discovery algorithm that constructs Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) by maximizing a scoring metric. It is optimized for both linear functional relations and Gaussian noise.
The user has already selected the algorithm: FGES

Now, we need to set up the primary hyperparameters for this algorithm. Please consider the dataset characteristics and the algorithm requirements to suggest appropriate values for the following hyperparameters:

[PRIMARY_HYPERPARAMETERS]

For each primary hyperparameter, provide:
1. The full name of the hyperparameter that is aligned with your understanding ('independence test', 'max depth', 'score function', etc.)
2. The suggested value
3. A brief explanation of why this value is appropriate given the dataset characteristics and algorithm requirements
4. Each primary hyperparameter is provided with a default value, which should be adjusted based on the dataset characteristics and algorithm requirements

Actively use and reason with the following information about each hyperparameter to inform your decisions:

"{\n    \"algorithm_name\": \"FGES\",\n    \"sparsity\": {\n      \"meaning\": \"Acts as a penalty discount factor in the scoring function, influencing the trade-off between model complexity and fit by favoring simpler graphs with fewer edges.\",\n      \"suggested_values\": {\n        \"default\": 10\n      },\n      \"reasoning\": \"Higher sparsity reduces the penalty on model complexity, allowing for more edges and improving computational efficiency, while lower sparsity enforces stricter penalties, leading to simpler, more parsimonious graphs at the cost of increased computation time.\"\n    }\n  }\n  "

Please provide your suggestions in a structured JSON format. Your response should look like this:

{
  "algorithm": "FGES",
  "hyperparameters": {
    "[HYPERPARAMETER_1_NAME]": {
      "full_name": "[HYPERPARAMETER_1_FULL_NAME]",
      "value": [SUGGESTED_VALUE],
      "explanation": "[BRIEF_EXPLANATION]"
    },
    "[HYPERPARAMETER_2_NAME]": {
      "full_name": "[HYPERPARAMETER_2_FULL_NAME]",
      "value": [SUGGESTED_VALUE],
      "explanation": "[BRIEF_EXPLANATION]"
    },
    ...
  }
}

Please always determine the hyperparameters from its corresponding "Suggested Values" part, DO NOT use any values just exist in other context but not in "Suggested Values".

Please consider the trade-offs between accuracy and computational efficiency when suggesting values. If you're unsure about a specific value, you may suggest using the default value and explain why.

Please provide your hyperparameter suggestions following this JSON structure.
