Given a dataset with the following properties:

1. Columns: Raf	Mek	Plcg	PIP2	PIP3	Erk	Akt	PKA	PKC	P38	Jnk
2. Statistics:
The dataset has the following characteristics:

Data Type: The overall data type is Continuous.

The sample size is 853 with 11 features. This dataset is not time-series data. Data Quality: There are no missing values in the dataset.

Statistical Properties:
- Linearity: The relationships between variables are predominantly linear.
- Gaussian Errors: The errors in the data do follow a Gaussian distribution.
- Heterogeneity: The dataset is not heterogeneous. 





We have selected the following algorithm for causal discovery:

Algorithm: PCMCI
Description: 
The user has already selected the algorithm: PCMCI

Now, we need to set up the primary hyperparameters for this algorithm. Please consider the dataset characteristics and the algorithm requirements to suggest appropriate values for the following hyperparameters:

[PRIMARY_HYPERPARAMETERS]

For each primary hyperparameter, provide:
1. The full name of the hyperparameter that is aligned with your understanding ('independence test', 'max depth', 'score function', etc.)
2. The suggested value
3. A brief explanation of why this value is appropriate given the dataset characteristics and algorithm requirements
4. Each primary hyperparameter is provided with a default value, which should be adjusted based on the dataset characteristics and algorithm requirements

Actively use and reason with the following information about each hyperparameter to inform your decisions:
