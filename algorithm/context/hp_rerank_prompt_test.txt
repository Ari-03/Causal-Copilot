2. Statistics:
The dataset has the following characteristics:

Data Type: The overall data type is Mixture.

The sample size is 1460 with 75 features. This dataset is not time-series data. Data Quality: There are missing values in the dataset.

Statistical Properties:
- Linearity: The relationships between variables are not predominantly linear.
- Gaussian Errors: The errors in the data do not follow a Gaussian distribution.
- Heterogeneity: The dataset is heterogeneous. 

- Domain Index: YearBuilt

We have selected the following algorithm for causal discovery:

Algorithm: CDNOD
Description: CDNOD is a constraint-based method that employs various conditional independence tests to discover causal structures. It is designed to accommodate shifting distributions and can manage the complexities often found in diverse datasets.
CDNOD is particularly designed for nonstationary and heterogeneous data, which closely aligns with the dataset's characteristics. Its ability to manage mixed data types and ensure robustness in complex environments, combined with is suitable execution time, makes it the ideal choice.

Now, we need to set up the primary hyperparameters for this algorithm. Please consider the dataset characteristics and the algorithm requirements to suggest appropriate values for the following hyperparameters:

[PRIMARY_HYPERPARAMETERS]

For each primary hyperparameter, provide:
1. The full name of the hyperparameter that is aligned with your understanding ('independence test', 'max depth', 'score function', etc.)
2. The suggested value
3. A brief explanation of why this value is appropriate given the dataset characteristics and algorithm requirements
4. Each primary hyperparameter is provided with a default value, which should be adjusted based on the dataset characteristics and algorithm requirements

Actively use and reason with the following information about each hyperparameter to inform your decisions:

Please provide your suggestions in a structured JSON format. Your response should look like this:

Please always determine the hyperparameters from its corresponding "Suggested Values" part, DO NOT use any values just exist in other context but not in "Suggested Values".

Please consider the trade-offs between accuracy and computational efficiency when suggesting values. If you're unsure about a specific value, you may suggest using the default value and explain why.

Please provide your hyperparameter suggestions following this JSON structure.
