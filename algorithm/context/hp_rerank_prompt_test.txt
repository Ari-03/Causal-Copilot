Given a dataset with the following properties:

1. Columns: Height	Age	Whole_weight	Diameter	Length	Shell_weight
2. Statistics:
The dataset has the following characteristics:

Data Type: The overall data type is Continuous.

The sample size is 4177 with 6 features. This dataset is not time-series data. Data Quality: There are no missing values in the dataset.

Statistical Properties:
- Linearity: The relationships between variables are not predominantly linear.
- Gaussian Errors: The errors in the data do not follow a Gaussian distribution.
- Heterogeneity: The dataset is not heterogeneous. 





We have selected the following algorithm for causal discovery:

Algorithm: GES
Description: The GES (Greedy Equivalence Search) algorithm is a score-based method that searches for the best network structure based on a scoring metric. It is capable of distinguishing between directed and undirected edges to form a CPDAG output.
The GES algorithm exhibits the best performance in scenarios of heterogeneity and measurement error while maintaining a balanced efficiency rating. Its ability to manage various types of data distributions and deliver stable results across different conditions gives it a distinct advantage over PC and FCI in practical applications. This makes GES the best choice for this dataset, as it handles complex relations more effectively without significant computational burden.

Now, we need to set up the primary hyperparameters for this algorithm. Please consider the dataset characteristics and the algorithm requirements to suggest appropriate values for the following hyperparameters:

[PRIMARY_HYPERPARAMETERS]

For each primary hyperparameter, provide:
1. The full name of the hyperparameter that is aligned with your understanding ('independence test', 'max depth', 'score function', etc.)
2. The suggested value
3. A brief explanation of why this value is appropriate given the dataset characteristics and algorithm requirements
4. Each primary hyperparameter is provided with a default value, which should be adjusted based on the dataset characteristics and algorithm requirements

Actively use and reason with the following information about each hyperparameter to inform your decisions:

"{\n  \"algorithm_name\": \"GES\",\n  \"score_func\": {\n    \"meaning\": \"Score function to be used\",\n    \"suggested_values\": {\n      \"default\": \"local_score_BIC\",\n      \"BIC\": \"local_score_BIC\",\n      \"BDeu\": \"local_score_BDeu\",\n      \"marginal_general\": \"local_score_marginal_general\",\n      \"marginal_multi\": \"local_score_marginal_multi\"\n    },\n    \"reasoning\": \"Use 'local_score_BIC' for a good balance of fit and complexity for linear data. 'BDeu' for discrete data. 'marginal_general' and 'marginal_multi' are powerful for complex data such as nonlinear data but time-consuming.

'marginal_multi' leverages non-parametric generalized score and marginal likelihood to select the best model.\"\n  },\n  \"maxP\": {\n    \"meaning\": \"Allowed maximum number of parents when searching the graph\",\n    \"suggested_values\": {\n      \"default\": null,\n      \"small_graph\": 3,\n      \"medium_graph\": 5,\n      \"large_graph\": 7\n    },\n    \"reasoning\": \"For graphs with <10 nodes, use null (no limit) to explore all possibilities.

Please provide your suggestions in a structured JSON format. Your response should look like this:

{
  "algorithm": "GES",
  "hyperparameters": {
    "[HYPERPARAMETER_1_NAME]": {
      "full_name": "[HYPERPARAMETER_1_FULL_NAME]",
      "value": [SUGGESTED_VALUE],
      "explanation": "[BRIEF_EXPLANATION]"
    },
    "[HYPERPARAMETER_2_NAME]": {
      "full_name": "[HYPERPARAMETER_2_FULL_NAME]",
      "value": [SUGGESTED_VALUE],
      "explanation": "[BRIEF_EXPLANATION]"
    },
    ...
  }
}

Please always determine the hyperparameters from its corresponding "Suggested Values" part, DO NOT use any values just exist in other context but not in "Suggested Values".

Please consider the trade-offs between accuracy and computational efficiency when suggesting values. If you're unsure about a specific value, you may suggest using the default value and explain why.

Please provide your hyperparameter suggestions following this JSON structure.
