Given a dataset with the following properties:

1. Columns: Cement	Blast_furnace_slag	Fly_ash	Water	Superplasticizer	Coarse_aggregate	Fine_aggregate	Age	Compressive_strength
2. Statistics:
The dataset has the following characteristics:

Data Type: The overall data type is Continuous.

The sample size is 1030 with 9 features. This dataset is not time-series data. 

Data Quality: There are no missing values in the dataset.

Statistical Properties:
- Linearity: The relationships between variables are not predominantly linear.
- Gaussian Errors: The errors in the data do not follow a Gaussian distribution.
- Heterogeneity: The dataset is not heterogeneous. 





We have selected the following algorithm for causal discovery:

Algorithm: GES
Description: User specifies this algorithm.

Now, we need to set up the primary hyperparameters for this algorithm. Please consider the dataset characteristics and the algorithm requirements to suggest appropriate values for the following hyperparameters:

[PRIMARY_HYPERPARAMETERS]

For each primary hyperparameter, provide:
1. The full name of the hyperparameter that is aligned with your understanding ('independence test', 'max depth', 'score function', etc.)
2. The suggested value
3. A brief explanation of why this value is appropriate given the dataset characteristics and algorithm requirements
4. Each primary hyperparameter is provided with a default value, which should be adjusted based on the dataset characteristics and algorithm requirements
5. For time-series data, give a higher priority to the statistically estimated lag order provided under the Statistics section.

Here is the CUDA/GPU availability to help you decide hyperparameters:


Current machine doesn't support CUDA, do not choose any GPU-powered algorithms.

Actively use and reason with the following information about each hyperparameter to inform your decisions:

"{\n  \"algorithm_name\": \"GES\",\n  \"score_func\": {\n    \"meaning\": \"Score function to be used\",\n    \"available_values\": {\n      \"default\": \"local_score_BIC\",\n      \"BIC\": \"local_score_BIC\",\n      \"BDeu\": \"local_score_BDeu\",\n      \"marginal_general\": \"local_score_marginal_general\",\n      \"marginal_multi\": \"local_score_marginal_multi\"\n    },\n    \"expert_suggestion\": \"Use 'local_score_BIC' for a good balance of fit and complexity for linear data. 'BDeu' for discrete data. local_score_marginal_general and marginal_multi are powerful for complex data such as nonlinear data but time-consuming. local_score_marginal_general leverages non-parametric generalized score and cross-validation to select the best model. local_score_marginal_multi leverages non-parametric generalized score and marginal likelihood to select the best model. Note [IMPORTANT]: local_score_marginal_general and local_score_marginal_multi are extremely slow. Only consider local_score_marginal_general if the variable size is less than 5. Do not consider local_score_marginal_multi since it is buggy now.\"\n  },\n  \"maxP\": {\n    \"meaning\": \"Allowed maximum number of parents when searching the graph\",\n    \"available_values\": {\n      \"default\": null,\n      \"small_graph\": 3,\n      \"medium_graph\": 5,\n      \"large_graph\": 7\n    },\n    \"expert_suggestion\": \"For graphs with <10 nodes, use null (no limit) to explore all possibilities. For 10-25 nodes, limit maxP to 3. For 25-50 nodes, use maxP=5. For >50 nodes, use maxP=7 to reduce computational complexity. Each additional parent can increase runtime exponentially.\"\n  }\n} "

Please provide your suggestions in a structured JSON format. Your response should look like this:

{
  "algorithm": "GES",
  "hyperparameters": {
    "[HYPERPARAMETER_1_NAME]": {
      "full_name": "[HYPERPARAMETER_1_FULL_NAME]",
      "value": [SUGGESTED_VALUE],
      "explanation": "[BRIEF_EXPLANATION]"
    },

      "value": [SUGGESTED_VALUE],
      "explanation": "[BRIEF_EXPLANATION]"
    },
    ...
  }
}

Please always determine the hyperparameters from its corresponding "Suggested Values" part, DO NOT use any values just exist in other context but not in "Suggested Values".

Please consider the trade-offs between accuracy and computational efficiency when suggesting values. If you're unsure about a specific value, you may suggest using the default value and explain why.

Please consider using the estimated time lag value. If you think a different value might be useful for the given context, you may suggest the value and explain why it will be better.

Please provide your hyperparameter suggestions following this JSON structure.
