### AcceleratedLiNGAM

- **Description**: The AcceleratedLiNGAM algorithm is a GPU-accelerated version of LiNGAM that performs linear non-Gaussian acyclic model estimation in parallel on GPU.

- **Advantages**
    - Significantly faster than standard LiNGAM implementations due to parallel processing of matrix operations on GPU
    - Maintains the unique identification properties of LiNGAM
    - Efficient for large-scale datasets with many variables

- **Limitations**
    - GPU memory constraints limit the maximum size of input data
    - Still requires the core LiNGAM assumptions of linearity and non-Gaussianity
    - Matrix operations precision may be affected by GPU floating point arithmetic

- **Suitable Cases**:
    - Large-scale causal discovery problems in econometrics, neuroscience, and finance
    - Scenarios with many variables where computational speed is crucial
    - Applications with known non-Gaussian noise distributions requiring fast processing
