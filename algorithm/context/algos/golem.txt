### GOLEM (Gradient-based Optimization of Local score with Enhanced Memory)

- **Description**: An efficient variant of NOTEARS that improves convergence speed and memory efficiency while maintaining similar accuracy in causal discovery.

- **Assumptions**:
    - **Acyclicity**: The underlying causal structure is a DAG.
    - **Linearity**: Assumes linear relationships between variables.
    - **Noise Model**: Supports both equal and non-equal variance assumptions.
    - **No Hidden Confounders**: All relevant variables are observed.

- **Advantages**:
    - **Efficiency**: Faster convergence than original NOTEARS.
    - **Memory Efficient**: Better memory utilization for large-scale problems.
    - **Flexible Noise Modeling**: Supports both equal and non-equal variance assumptions.
    - **Stability**: More stable optimization process.

- **Limitations**:
    - **Linear Relationships**: Base version assumes linear relationships.
    - **Sensitivity to Parameters**: Performance can depend on hyperparameter choices.
    - **Local Optima**: May converge to local optima.

- **Suitable Cases**:
    - **Large-scale Problems**: Especially effective for high-dimensional data.
    - **Memory-constrained Environments**: Better memory efficiency than NOTEARS.
    - **Linear Causal Relationships**: When relationships are approximately linear.
