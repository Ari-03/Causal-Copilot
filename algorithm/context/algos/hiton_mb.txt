### HITON_MB (HIerarchical Tree Of Neighbors)

- **Description**: HITON_MB is a sophisticated Markov Blanket discovery algorithm that uses a hierarchical approach to identify the MB of target variables. It combines local causal discovery with statistical tests in a theoretically sound manner.

- **Assumptions**
    - **Faithfulness**: The probability distribution is faithful to the underlying graph
    - **Causal Sufficiency**: All common causes are observed
    - **Reliability**: The statistical tests are reliable given the sample size
    - **Composition Property**: The data distribution satisfies the composition property

- **Advantages**
    - Theoretically sound with formal guarantees
    - Efficient handling of high-dimensional data
    - Better control of false positives
    - Hierarchical approach reduces computational complexity
    - More sample efficient than many other MB algorithms

- **Limitations**
    - Can be sensitive to violations of faithfulness
    - Requires careful tuning of significance levels
    - May miss weak dependencies in small samples
    - Performance depends on the quality of statistical tests

- **Suitable Cases**
    - High-dimensional datasets requiring efficient feature selection
    - Applications where theoretical guarantees are important
    - Cases requiring careful control of false discoveries
    - Biomedical and genomic applications where sample size is limited
