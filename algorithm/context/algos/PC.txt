Below is a seven-dimension profile of the PC (Peter–Clark) algorithm, integrating (1) the hyperparameter file, (2) the benchmarking results, and (3) external knowledge about the algorithm and its typical use cases. References or paraphrased remarks from the external sources are indicated where relevant.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. HYPER-PARAMETERS SENSITIVITY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Number of Key Hyperparameters  
  - The PC algorithm has three main hyperparameters:  
    1. α (alpha): Significance level for conditional independence tests.  
    2. indep_test: Choice of conditional independence test (e.g., Fisher’s Z, chi-square, G-square, KCI variants).  
    3. depth: Maximum depth for the skeleton search phase.  

• Tuning Difficulty  
  - α is typically the most critical parameter, with recommended defaults in the provided file (e.g., 0.05 for moderate sample sizes, 0.1 for smaller samples, 0.01 for very large samples). These guidelines simplify tuning for different dataset sizes.  
  - The choice of indep_test can be straightforward (Fisher’s Z for continuous data, chi-square for discrete data, etc.), though advanced options (like KCI) may require more specialized knowledge.  
  - depth has a default of -1 (unlimited), but it can be restricted to reduce runtime for large graphs. The suggested rule of thumb scales with the number of nodes, setting smaller depths for larger graphs.  

• Sensitivity  
  - Small changes in α can produce noticeable effects on edge detection: lower α yields more conservative edge selection (fewer false positives) but may lead to more false negatives.  
  - Shifting from an unlimited depth (depth = -1) to a restricted depth (like 1 to 3) can significantly speed up the search on large graphs but may miss subtler causal relationships.  
  - Changing the independence test (e.g., from a linear Fisher test to a non-parametric test like KCI) can likewise alter both runtime and the ability to capture non-linear causal links.  

• Critique/Extension  
  - Parameters that control graph-search complexity (depth) can drastically reduce runtime but may compromise completeness in highly connected graphs.  
  - The α threshold has more direct influence on statistical testing; even small shifts in α can change the number of edges found. Hence, domain knowledge is often helpful to choose a good α.  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2. ROBUSTNESS & SCALABILITY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Tolerance to Bad Data Quality  
  - Benchmarks (File #2) indicate that PC’s performance tends to degrade when data quality drops (e.g., missing data or measurement error). In fact, PC ranked relatively low in measurement error and missing data tolerance, suggesting it does not handle either type of bad data as robustly as some other methods.  
  - It lacks built-in methods for imputation; in practice, users might preprocess missing values or use more advanced PC variants (e.g., PC-missing).  

• Tolerance to Sparse vs. Dense Connected Systems  
  - PC often performs better on sparse systems, since the number of conditional independence tests remains more manageable. For dense graphs, the algorithm may require many tests, increasing the risk of both false positives and elevated runtime.  
  - From a benchmarking standpoint, when confronted with moderately dense networks, performance declines more in runtime than in accuracy, highlighting the combinatorial explosion of tests in denser graphs.  

• Scalability  
  - According to File #2, the algorithm scored moderately on scalability, reflecting that it can handle dozens to a few hundred variables well, but may slow down noticeably beyond that range.  
  - Parallelization or restricting depth can mitigate the combinatorial explosion in larger problems but may reduce the completeness of causal edges.  

• Critique/Extension  
  - Parallel-PC implementations exist and can be employed on multi-core hardware to improve speed.  
  - Using approximation strategies (like a lower maximum depth or partitioning variables) can be beneficial when the dataset contains hundreds or thousands of variables, though these techniques might weaken correctness guarantees.  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
3. MIXED DATA & COMPLEX FUNCTIONS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Noise Type  
  - The PC algorithm’s traditional setup often presupposes approximately Gaussian errors for continuous data, but other independence tests allow for broader noise distributions.  
  - Benchmarks (File #2) suggested that PC performed somewhat lower when confronted with more diverse or non-Gaussian noise, although advanced tests (KCI, RCIT) can address non-linearity.  

• Mixed Data (Continuous & Discrete)  
  - PC can integrate different conditional independence tests: Fisher’s Z or partial correlation for continuous variables; chi-square or G-square for discrete; or a mix for hybrid data.  
  - Some PC implementations provide direct support for mixed data via specialized tests like G-square, allowing simultaneous handling of continuous and categorical variables.  

• Heterogeneous Data  
  - Benchmark results (File #2) show it scored in the middle ranges under “Heterogeneity.” It can handle moderate changes in distribution across variables, provided a suitable test is chosen.  
  - Marked shifts across subsets of data may require domain-driven adjustments or advanced versions (like FCI for partial latent confounding).  

• Complex Functional Forms  
  - The standard PC algorithm is tailored for linear (or near-linear) dependencies, but employing a kernel-based test (e.g., KCI) can detect non-linear relationships.  
  - Non-linear extensions usually come with higher computational burdens, which can be partially offset by “fastKCI” or “RCIT.”  

• Critique/Extension  
  - Users often underestimate how crucial the independence test choice is when dealing with non-linear patterns. A robust non-parametric test can significantly improve detection of non-linear causal links.  
  - Overfitting concerns can arise in small samples if a highly flexible test is used without proper regularization or multiple testing corrections.  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
4. COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Theoretical Time Complexity  
  - The PC algorithm can have a worst-case time complexity of <temp>[O(n^(k+2))]</temp>, where n is the number of variables and k is the maximum degree of a node in the true graph.  

• Variability in Practical Usage  
  - Despite the polynomial (sometimes high-order) worst-case bound, many real-world graphs are sparse, so runtime is often much lower.  
  - Increasing depth or lowering α can drive up the number of tests, and thus runtime can spike. Conversely, restricting depth dampens the combinatorial explosion but risks missing some edges.  

• Critique/Extension  
  - The worst-case scenario might be rarely encountered in practical sparse settings. However, in denser structures or with large depth parameters, runtime can indeed grow significantly.  
  - Parallelization can help distribute the skeleton-discovery phase across multiple CPUs, improving the typical runtime on large datasets.  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
5. INTERPRETABILITY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Output Format  
  - PC outputs a CPDAG (Completed Partially Directed Acyclic Graph). This graph shows which edges are definitely directed, as well as edges uncertain about orientation.  
  - Some implementations also provide adjacency matrices with confidence measures (e.g., p-values).  

• Strength of the Output Format  
  - CPDAGs are considered quite interpretable: they clarify which directions are inferred and which remain undetermined.  
  - Many software packages (e.g., Tetrad, pcalg) provide visualization tools to help interpret a CPDAG.  

• Limitations of the Output Format  
  - Edges in the “partially” directed region can generate ambiguity, as the algorithm leaves some edges unoriented if the data are insufficiently informative.  
  - In high-dimensional or complex domains, the resulting graph might still be large and cumbersome to interpret without additional domain knowledge.  

• Critique/Extension  
  - Domain experts frequently refine or manually orient ambiguous edges, especially in specialized fields such as genomics or neuroscience.  
  - Some suggest performing a stability or bootstrap analysis to highlight edges that are consistently inferred across subsamples.  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
6. ASSUMPTIONS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Critical Assumptions  
  - Causal Markov condition: Each variable is conditionally independent of its non-descendants, given its parents.  
  - Faithfulness: All and only the conditional independencies in the true structure are reflected in the data.  
  - Causal sufficiency: No unobserved confounders of the measured variables.  
  - Acyclicity: The underlying causal structure forms a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).  

• Violation Impact  
  - Missing confounders can lead to spurious or missing edges.  
  - Unfaithful data-generating mechanisms can hide true edges or create extra independencies.  
  - Feedback loops or cyclic structures break the acyclicity assumption, causing the algorithm to infer incomplete or incorrect edges.  

• Critique/Extension  
  - When hidden variable confounding is suspected, variants like FCI (Fast Causal Inference) or RFCI are recommended instead of basic PC.  
  - Many real-world systems include some feedback or non-stationary behavior, so partial violations are not uncommon. Users often need to test sensitivity or adopt extended algorithms.  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
7. (OPTIONAL) REAL-WORLD BENCHMARKS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Performance on Real Datasets  
  - Across a variety of real datasets (e.g., gene-expression data, brain connectivity data), PC tends to perform competitively for structure learning, provided the data are not extremely noisy or riddled with missing values.  
  - In some evaluations, PC was among the more accurate approaches for sparse graphs but was sometimes outperformed by score-based or hybrid methods on very noisy or dense data.  

• Practical Tips  
  - Combining PC with domain knowledge (e.g., known biological pathways) often yields improved orientation of edges.  
  - Limiting depth can drastically reduce computation time for high-dimensional data, but practitioners must confirm that the trade-off in missed edges is acceptable.  
  - Discussion forums and user groups consistently recommend verifying the sample size is sufficient for the chosen α level, or considering small-sample corrections if data are limited.  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
CONCLUSION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The PC algorithm remains a flagship approach in constraint-based causal discovery, prized for its interpretability (CPDAG output) and relatively direct hyperparameter tuning guidelines (notably α and depth). It is best applied in scenarios where:  
• The graph is not excessively dense.  
• The data generally meet Markov and faithfulness assumptions.  
• There are no severe missing data or measurement error problems, or these issues are pre-processed/handled externally.  
Recent developments in parallelization, alternative independence tests, and specialized PC variants help address non-linearities, mixed data, and large-scale settings. Nonetheless, potential users must keep in mind the algorithm’s sensitivity to significance thresholds, data assumptions, and the combinatorial explosion of conditional tests in bigger or denser networks.
