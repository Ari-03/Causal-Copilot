### IAMBnPC (IAMB and PC Combined)

- **Description**: IAMBnPC combines the IAMB algorithm with PC-algorithm style conditioning to improve the accuracy of Markov Blanket discovery. It uses the PC algorithm's local structure learning principles within the IAMB framework.

- **Assumptions**
    - **Faithfulness**: The independence relationships reflect the true causal structure
    - **Causal Sufficiency**: No unmeasured common causes exist
    - **Reliability**: The conditional independence tests are accurate
    - **Local Structure**: The local causal structure around target variables is identifiable

- **Advantages**
    - More accurate than standard IAMB due to PC-style conditioning
    - Better handles complex local structures
    - Reduces false positives through additional structural tests
    - More robust to ordering effects than basic IAMB

- **Limitations**
    - Higher computational complexity than basic IAMB
    - Requires more samples for reliable performance
    - More sensitive to violations of faithfulness
    - Can be affected by curse of dimensionality in conditioning sets

- **Suitable Cases**
    - Applications requiring high accuracy in MB discovery
    - Datasets with complex local causal structures
    - Cases where false positive control is crucial
    - Scenarios with sufficient sample size for reliable testing
