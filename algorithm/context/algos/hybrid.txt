### Hybrid (Combined Constraint-based and Functional Methods)

- **Description**: The Hybrid algorithm combines constraint-based methods (PC/GES) with functional model-based methods (ANM/PNL) to achieve more accurate causal direction determination. It first learns a CPDAG using constraint-based methods, then applies functional methods to orient remaining undirected edges.

- **Assumptions**
    - **Faithfulness**: The statistical dependencies in the data reflect the true causal structure
    - **Causal Sufficiency**: No hidden confounders exist in the system
    - **Reliability**: Both conditional independence tests and functional model tests are reliable
    - **Non-cyclic**: The underlying causal structure is acyclic
    - **Functional Model**: The causal mechanisms follow certain functional model assumptions (e.g., additive noise for ANM)

- **Advantages**
    - Combines strengths of multiple approaches
    - More accurate edge orientations than pure constraint-based methods
    - Can resolve more Markov equivalence relationships
    - Maintains theoretical guarantees from both methods
    - More robust due to complementary approaches

- **Limitations**
    - Higher computational complexity due to two-stage process
    - Requires more parameters to be tuned
    - May inherit limitations from both approaches
    - Sensitive to violations of functional model assumptions
    - Requires sufficient sample size for both stages

- **Suitable Cases**
    - Applications requiring high accuracy in causal direction
    - Datasets with adequate sample size for both stages
    - Cases where Markov equivalence needs to be resolved
    - Scenarios where multiple lines of evidence are needed
    - Problems where orientation accuracy is crucial
