Below is an in-depth profile of the MBOR (Markov Boundary OR) causal discovery algorithm, organized according to the seven “degrees” (dimensions) from the meta-prompt. The discussion integrates:  
• The provided hyperparameter settings (File #1).  
• The benchmarking results (File #2).  
• The external information about MBOR (File #3) and general knowledge of causal discovery methods.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Hyper-Parameters Sensitivity
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Number of Key Hyperparameters  
  MBOR has two primary hyperparameters that most strongly impact performance and output quality:  
  1) α (alpha): The significance level used for conditional independence tests.  
  2) indep_test: The choice of independence test method (e.g., 'fisherz', 'chisq', 'kci').  

• Tuning Difficulty  
  – α has recommended defaults that vary with sample size (e.g., 0.1 for <500 samples, 0.05 for medium sizes up to 10,000, and 0.01 for very large samples). These guidelines help non-experts adopt reasonable values. An LLM or domain expert can refine α based on the trade-off between false positives and false negatives.  
  – indep_test selection is fairly straightforward since each test is suited to different data types or assumptions (linear vs. nonlinear, continuous vs. discrete, etc.).  

• Sensitivity  
  – α: A higher α typically makes the algorithm more liberal about discovering edges (at the risk of false positives). Conversely, a smaller α is more conservative, potentially missing weaker but true causal links. Benchmarks (File #2) indicate that MBOR shows stable performance on noisy or partially missing data, suggesting moderate resilience to slightly suboptimal α choices.  
  – indep_test: Switching from a simple method (e.g., 'fisherz') to a more complex kernel-based test (e.g., 'kci') increases computational cost but can detect more nuanced (e.g., nonlinear) relationships.  

• Critique/Extension  
  – Parameters that control statistical testing (α and indep_test) often directly influence both false positives and runtime cost.  
  – In contrast, methods that limit search complexity (e.g., restricting conditioning set sizes) are handled internally by MBOR but are not explicitly exposed as tunable parameters in the provided JSON.  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2. Robustness & Scalability
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Tolerance to Bad Data Quality  
  – Missing Data: According to the benchmarking results (File #2), MBOR’s composite performance score on scenarios with missing data was relatively high, suggesting that MBOR efficiently handles moderate amounts of missing data.  
  – Measurement/Observation Error: File #2 also shows favorable “performance” and “efficiency” levels under measurement error, meaning MBOR’s statistical tests maintain reasonable accuracy even when moderate noise is introduced.  

• Tolerance to Sparse/Dense Connected Systems  
  – Although the benchmark data does not explicitly quantify sparsity vs. density, information from external sources (File #3) often cites MBOR as capable of dealing with graphs that can be moderately dense. Some feedback indicates MBOR can adapt well when relationships are numerous, though it may require more computational resources.  

• Scalability  
  – Benchmarking results label MBOR with moderate-to-high efficiency scores. MBOR reportedly scales to large sample sizes and a growing number of variables without drastic performance drops, especially if the user employs faster independence tests (e.g., 'fastkci' or 'rcit').  
  – Practical thresholds noted in File #3 suggest MBOR remains feasible for thousands (and, in some references, tens of thousands) of variables, though runtime grows with more variables.  

• Critique/Extension  
  – Parallelization potential: MBOR’s modular independence tests, especially kernel-based ones, can often be parallelized. This helps mitigate runtime issues on very large datasets or complex non-linear data.  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
3. Mixed Data & Complex Functions
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Noise Type  
  – MBOR does not strictly assume Gaussian noise; the user can select kernel-based tests (kci, fastkci, rcit) for more general, possibly non-Gaussian data.  

• Mixed Data (Continuous & Discrete)  
  – The “indep_test” hyperparameter supports 'chisq' (discrete) and 'gsq' (simple mixed). Combining these with continuous tests (e.g., 'fisherz') or kernel-based tests indicates MBOR can cover a broad range of data types.  

• Heterogeneous Data  
  – Under “Heterogeneity” in File #2, MBOR demonstrated relatively robust performance and efficiency. This implies that MBOR can remain stable even when data sources have different distributions, though strong distribution shifts may still require more careful test selection.  

• Complex Functional Forms  
  – By selecting 'kci', 'fastkci', or 'rcit', MBOR can detect nonlinear relationships. However, using these advanced tests may increase computational time.  


• Critique/Extension  
  – If the user defaults to simpler tests (e.g., 'fisherz'), MBOR behaves more like a linear/gaussian assumption method. For highly nonlinear problems, specialized tests are beneficial but more costly computationally.  
  – Overfitting can occur in small-sample scenarios if overly flexible tests are used (like advanced kernel-based tests) without adjusting α accordingly.  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
4. Computational Complexity
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Theoretical Time Complexity  
  – Exact expressions are not explicitly provided in the known references. Generally, constraint-based algorithms can experience exponential worst-case complexity in the number of variables or conditioning set sizes. Tentatively, one might expect an upper bound resembling <temp>[O(n^k)]</temp> for some finite k, though MBOR’s heuristics aim to reduce this in practice.  

• Variability in Practical Usage  
  – As α decreases, the algorithm tends to conduct more conditional independence checks (since edges are harder to discard), which can increase runtime.  
  – Choosing a more advanced test like 'kci' increases the per-test complexity but may reduce false positives in complex scenarios.  

• Critique/Extension  
  – MBOR’s worst-case runtime versus typical performance may diverge significantly; real-world benchmarks (File #2) show it performing at a moderate-to-efficient level compared with other large-scale methods.  
  – Parallel architectures can help offset the computational cost of repeated independence tests, especially kernel-based or permutation-based methods.  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
5. Interpretability
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Output Format  
  – MBOR typically outputs a Markov boundary (or Markov blanket) for each target variable. In graph form, it can be viewed as adjacency sets or a partial causal subgraph around the target.  

• Strength of the Output Format  
  – Focusing on each variable’s Markov boundary can be highly interpretable for feature selection tasks or localized causal analysis.  
  – Some implementations provide p-values or confidence scores for identified dependencies, though the availability of explicit confidence intervals may vary by library.  

• Limitations of the Output Format  
  – The orientation of edges in a complete causal graph (beyond local boundaries) may remain ambiguous if MBOR is used strictly in a local manner.  
  – In more complex networks (e.g., with feedback loops), interpreting each local boundary separately might require domain expertise to assemble a global picture.  

• Critique/Extension  
  – For domain-level explanation, merging local Markov boundaries into a cohesive directed acyclic graph can be challenging. Post-processing or domain knowledge often helps refine directions and confirm plausibility of discovered relationships.  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
6. Assumptions
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Critical Assumptions  
  – Standard constraint-based assumptions, including the Markov and faithfulness conditions, and causal sufficiency (i.e., no unobserved confounders).  
  – MBOR also often assumes that a well-defined Markov boundary exists for each variable of interest.  

• Violation Impact  
  – If faithfulness is violated or hidden confounders exist, MBOR may fail to recover the true dependencies reliably.  
  – The benchmarking data (File #2) shows MBOR maintaining decent stability under moderate noise and missing data, but severe assumption violations (e.g., extreme selection bias) were not explicitly tested.  

• Critique/Extension  
  – For partial violations (e.g., mild unmeasured confounding), MBOR might still yield insights, but the discovered boundaries or local structures could be incomplete or skewed.  
  – Some advanced variations incorporate hidden-variable detection, but that functionality is not explicitly detailed in the provided files.  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
7. (Optional) Real-World Benchmarks
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Performance on Real Datasets  
  – MBOR demonstrated competitive or above-average performance in scenarios with missing data, measurement error, and heterogeneous data (File #2).  
  – Community discussions (File #3) suggest MBOR has been tested in large-scale feature selection contexts (e.g., microarray experiments with many thousands of variables), where it performed comparably to other incremental Markov boundary learners.  

• Practical Tips  
  – For moderate data sizes, the default α = 0.05 often yields a good balance of edge discovery and false-positive control.  
  – When dealing with strongly nonlinear or mixed data, switching from 'fisherz' to kernel-based tests (e.g., 'kci') can improve accuracy, albeit at higher computational cost.  
  – Users typically find success pairing MBOR with parallel processing for large-scale problems, especially if independence tests are repeated many times.  

• Common Pitfalls  
  – Using too high an α in small-sample settings may inflate the number of learned edges. Conversely, too small an α in very large datasets can increase runtime and risk under-discovery of true edges.  
  – Overlooking domain knowledge might lead to confusion when assembling local boundaries into a global causal picture.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Overall, MBOR is a constraint-based method that localizes causal structure discovery via Markov boundaries and can adapt its independence tests to different data types and complexities. Its built-in handling of missing or noisy data and relatively efficient scalability with respect to both variables and samples make it a strong candidate for many real-world scenarios. However, like all constraint-based approaches, it relies on standard assumptions (e.g., faithfulness and sufficiency), so careful tuning of α and choosing an appropriate independence test are crucial to ensuring reliable and interpretable outcomes.────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
