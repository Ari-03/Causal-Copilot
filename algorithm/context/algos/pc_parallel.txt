### PCParallel

- **Description**: Parallelized version of PC algorithm, achieved by parallelizing the CI tests at each step over multiple cores of the underlying hardware. 

- **Assumptions**
    - **Causal Sufficiency**: No hidden confounders exist, meaning all relevant variables are observed.
    - **Faithfulness**: The observed statistical dependencies reflect the true causal structure, without any coincidental independencies.
    - **Markov Condition**: Each variable is conditionally independent of its non-effects given its direct causes.
    - **Non-cyclic**: The underlying causal structure is acyclic.

- **Advantages**
    - Faster and more scalable over high dimensional datasets
    - Results are independent of the order of the variables. 
    - Implements the stable-PC with minimal loss in accuracy

- **Limitations**
    - Works under the assumption that all the cores have similar performance
    - Significant memory consumption for large datasets 
    - Tradeoff between number of cores and synchronization of results

- **Suitable Cases**:
    - Datasets with large number of variables and sample size where computational efficiency is crucial.
    - Scenarios where all relevant variables are observed and the underlying causal structure is assumed to be acyclic.
