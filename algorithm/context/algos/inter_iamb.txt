### InterIAMB (Interleaved Incremental Association Markov Blanket)

- **Description**: InterIAMB is an improved version of the IAMB algorithm that interleaves the growing and shrinking phases of MB discovery. It uses a forward-backward strategy with interleaved steps to identify the Markov Blanket more efficiently.

- **Assumptions**
    - **Faithfulness**: The probability distribution is faithful to the underlying DAG
    - **Causal Sufficiency**: All relevant variables are measured
    - **Reliability**: The conditional independence tests are reliable
    - **Markov Condition**: Each variable is conditionally independent of its non-descendants given its parents

- **Advantages**
    - More efficient than standard IAMB due to interleaved phases
    - Reduces the number of false positives during the growing phase
    - Generally requires fewer conditional independence tests
    - Better handles datasets with strong dependencies

- **Limitations**
    - Still sensitive to the reliability of independence tests
    - Performance depends on the ordering of variables
    - May struggle with weak dependencies
    - Requires sufficient sample size for reliable testing

- **Suitable Cases**
    - Large datasets where computational efficiency is important
    - Cases where false positives need to be minimized
    - Applications requiring reliable MB discovery
    - Scenarios with strong variable dependencies
