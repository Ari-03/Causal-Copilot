### AcceleratedPC

- **Description**: The AcceleratedPC algorithm is a GPU-accelerated constraint-based method that conduct the conditional independence test in parallel on GPU.
- **Advantages**
    - Extremely efficient for large-scale datasets due to its ability to parallely run massive conditional independence tests.
- **Limitations**
    - The GPU usage is limited by the GPU memory size. The memory usage is proportional to the number of variables and the sample size.
- **Suitable Cases**:
    - Large datasets where computational efficiency is crucial.
    - Scenarios where all relevant variables are observed and the underlying causal structure is assumed to be acyclic.
