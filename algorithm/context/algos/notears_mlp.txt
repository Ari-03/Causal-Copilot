### NOTEARS-MLP (Nonlinear)

- **Description**: An extension of NOTEARS that uses multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) to model nonlinear relationships between variables while maintaining the continuous optimization approach.

- **Assumptions**:
    - **Acyclicity**: The underlying causal structure is a DAG.
    - **Nonlinear Relationships**: Can capture complex nonlinear relationships between variables.
    - **No Hidden Confounders**: All relevant variables are observed.
    - **Sufficient Data**: Requires more data than linear NOTEARS due to increased model complexity.

- **Advantages**:
    - **Nonlinear Modeling**: Can capture complex nonlinear relationships.
    - **Continuous Optimization**: Maintains the efficient optimization approach of NOTEARS.
    - **Flexibility**: Can approximate various forms of nonlinear relationships.

- **Limitations**:
    - **Computational Cost**: More computationally intensive than linear NOTEARS.
    - **Sample Size Requirements**: Needs more data for reliable estimation.
    - **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: Performance can be sensitive to neural network architecture.

- **Suitable Cases**:
    - **Complex Systems**: Where relationships are known to be nonlinear.
    - **Large Datasets**: When sufficient data is available for training.
    - **High-dimensional Problems**: Can handle many variables with nonlinear relationships.
