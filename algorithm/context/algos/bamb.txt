### BAMB (Bayesian Adaptive Markov Blanket)

- **Description**: BAMB is a Markov Blanket discovery algorithm that uses a Bayesian approach to adaptively select variables. It combines the advantages of constraint-based and Bayesian methods to identify the Markov Blanket of target variables.

- **Assumptions**
    - **Faithfulness**: The statistical dependencies in the data reflect the true underlying causal structure
    - **Causal Sufficiency**: All common causes of measured variables are included in the dataset
    - **Reliability**: The statistical tests used are reliable given the sample size
    - **Local Composition**: The local distribution around each target variable follows the composition property

- **Advantages**
    - Adaptive selection strategy reduces the number of conditional independence tests
    - More robust to noise compared to traditional MB algorithms
    - Better handles high-dimensional data with limited sample sizes
    - Provides probabilistic confidence measures for MB membership

- **Limitations**
    - Computational complexity increases with the number of variables
    - Requires sufficient sample size for reliable independence testing
    - May be sensitive to violations of the faithfulness assumption
    - Performance depends on the quality of the independence test statistics

- **Suitable Cases**
    - High-dimensional datasets where feature selection is crucial
    - Cases where robust variable selection is needed under uncertainty
    - Scenarios where probabilistic confidence in feature selection is important
    - Applications requiring interpretable feature selection results
