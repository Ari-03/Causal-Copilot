# Causal Discovery Algorithm Tagging

## CRITICAL: Performance Ratings Are Conditional
⚠️ **All performance ratings assume appropriate data property matching**
⚠️ **An algorithm with "Strong" rating will perform POORLY on mismatched data**
⚠️ **Data property alignment MUST take precedence over performance ratings**

## Selection Priority (VARIES BY PROBLEM SCALE)

### For Small to Medium-Scale Problems (< 50 variables)
1. Graph density match (Sparse/Dense)
2. Functional form match (Linear/Nonlinear)
3. Noise assumptions match (Gaussian/NonGaussian)
4. Empirical performance (only after matches verified)
5. Efficiency/Scalability

### For Large-Scale Problems (≥ 50 variables)
1. Scalability/Efficiency (must be able to complete in reasonable time)
2. Graph density match (Sparse/Dense)
3. Functional form match (Linear/Nonlinear)
4. Noise assumptions match (Gaussian/NonGaussian)
5. Empirical performance (only after all above verified)

### For Very Large-Scale Problems (≥ 100 variables)
1. Scalability (must support target variable count)
2. Efficiency (runtime must be feasible with available resources)
3. Graph density match (if algorithm can handle the scale)
4. Other compatibility factors (as feasible)

## Performance Categories
- **Robust**: ≥80% accuracy with matched data properties
- **Strong**: 60-80% accuracy with matched data properties
- **Moderate**: 40-60% accuracy with matched data properties
- **Limited**: <40% accuracy even with matched data properties
- **Poor**: Unreliable even with matched data properties

## Algorithm Tag Categories

1. **Availability**: Available, Unavailable

3. **Functional Form**: 
   - Linear: Optimized for linear relationships
   - Nonlinear: Optimized for non-linear relationships
   - Flexible: Handles both linear and non-linear relationships effectively

4. **Noise**: 
   - Gaussian: Performance drops with non-Gaussian noise
   - NonGaussian: Performance improves with non-Gaussian noise
   - Flexible: Similar performance between Gaussian and non-Gaussian noise

5. **Latent Variable Tolerance**: 
   - Robust: Maintains high performance with latent variables
   - Moderate: Maintains moderate performance with latent variables

6. **Distribution Shift**: 
   - Heterogeneous: Maintains high performance under heterogeneity
   - Homogenous: Performance drops under heterogeneity

7. **Scalability & Efficiency**: 
   - Extreme (>100 vars): Handles up to more than 100 variables
   - Very High (50-100 vars): Handles up to 100 variables
   - High (20-50 vars): Handles up to 50 variables
   - Moderate (10-20 vars): Handles up to 20 variables
   - Limited (<10 vars): Limited to <10 variables or runtime >60 min
   - Poor: Extremely long runtime (>4 hours)

8. **Empirical Performance**: Based on overall benchmark score
   - Robust: High overall score (requires matched data properties)
   - Strong: Good overall score (requires matched data properties)
   - Moderate: Average overall score (requires matched data properties)
   - Limited: Below average overall score
   - Poor: Low overall score
   NOTE: Empirical performance is solely compute with accuracy metrics, not regarding efficiency.

9. **Output Format**: DAG, CPDAG, PAG

10. **Graph Density Preference**:
   - Sparse-Preferring: Algorithm performs significantly better on sparse graphs
   - Dense-Preferring: Algorithm performs significantly better on dense graphs
   - Density-Robust: Algorithm maintains consistent performance across different graph densities
