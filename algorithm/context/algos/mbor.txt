### MBOR (Markov Blanket and Optimal Reinsertion)

- **Description**: MBOR is a hybrid Markov Blanket discovery algorithm that combines traditional MB learning with an optimal reinsertion phase. It first identifies a candidate MB and then optimally reinserts potentially missed variables.

- **Assumptions**
    - **Faithfulness**: The independence relationships in the data correspond to the graph structure
    - **Causal Sufficiency**: No hidden confounders exist in the system
    - **Correct CI Tests**: The conditional independence tests are reliable
    - **DAG Structure**: The underlying causal structure is a directed acyclic graph

- **Advantages**
    - More robust to false negatives through reinsertion phase
    - Better handles complex dependency structures
    - Reduces the impact of early mistakes in MB discovery
    - Generally achieves better recall than traditional MB algorithms

- **Limitations**
    - Higher computational cost due to reinsertion phase
    - May be sensitive to the choice of independence test
    - Requires larger sample sizes for reliable reinsertion decisions
    - Can be affected by local optimality in the reinsertion phase

- **Suitable Cases**
    - Applications where missing important variables is costly
    - Datasets with complex dependency structures
    - Scenarios where high recall is more important than computational speed
    - Cases where traditional MB methods miss important variables
