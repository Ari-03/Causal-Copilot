Given a dataset with the following properties:

1. Columns: [COLUMNS]
2. Statistics:
[STATISTICS INFO]
3. Background Knowledge:
[KNOWLEDGE_INFO]

We have selected the following algorithm for causal discovery:

Algorithm: [ALGORITHM_NAME]
Description: [ALGORITHM_DESCRIPTION]

Now, we need to determine the optimal hyperparameters for this algorithm. I'll guide you through a systematic approach to select values that prioritize accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency for moderate graph sizes.

Primary hyperparameters to configure: [PRIMARY_HYPERPARAMETERS]

For each hyperparameter, please follow this structured approach:

Step 1: Understand the dataset characteristics
   - Consider the number of variables (graph size)
   - Analyze sample size and data distribution
   - Note if data is linear/nonlinear, continuous/discrete/mixed
   - For time-series data, prioritize the statistically estimated lag order

Step 2: Assess computational resources
   - Consider the hardware constraints and GPU availability:
   [CUDA_WARNING]

   - Prioritize to GPU implemented hyperparameter when dealing with large graph (variable size > 100) to achieve more efficient speedup

Step 3: Evaluate each hyperparameter's impact on accuracy vs. efficiency
   - Critical parameters affecting accuracy (e.g., significance levels, independence tests)
   - Parameters affecting computational complexity (e.g., search depth, maximum conditions)
   - Parameters controlling sparsity (e.g., regularization, thresholds)

Step 4: Analyze algorithm-specific recommendations
   - Review expert suggestions for each parameter:
   [HYPERPARAMETER_INFO]

Step 5: Make final decisions based on:
   - For moderate graph sizes (<50 variables), prioritize accuracy over speed
   - For large graphs (>50 variables), balance accuracy with feasibility and EFFICIENCY
   - For time-series data, carefully consider temporal parameters

Please provide your suggestions in a structured JSON format, with detailed reasoning for each hyperparameter. Your response should look like this:

{
  "algorithm": "[ALGORITHM_NAME]",
  "hyperparameters": {
    "[HYPERPARAMETER_1_NAME]": {
      "full_name": "[HYPERPARAMETER_1_FULL_NAME]",
      "reasoning": "[YOUR_STEP_BY_STEP_REASONING_PROCESS]",
      "value": [SUGGESTED_VALUE],
      "explanation": "[BRIEF_EXPLANATION_OF_TRADEOFFS]"
    },
    "[HYPERPARAMETER_2_NAME]": {
      "full_name": "[HYPERPARAMETER_2_FULL_NAME]",
      "reasoning": "[YOUR_STEP_BY_STEP_REASONING_PROCESS]",
      "value": [SUGGESTED_VALUE],
      "explanation": "[BRIEF_EXPLANATION_OF_TRADEOFFS]"
    },
    ...
  }
}

Important guidelines:
1. Only select values from the "available_values" list for each hyperparameter
2. For moderate graph sizes (10-50 variables), prioritize accuracy over speed
3. For time-series data, give special attention to lag parameters based on statistical estimates
4. Consider independence test selection carefully based on data type and computational resources
5. For regularization parameters, consider the expected graph density
6. For search depth parameters, consider the complexity of potential causal relationships

Please provide your hyperparameter suggestions following this JSON structure, with clear reasoning that demonstrates you've considered the dataset characteristics, algorithm requirements, and computational constraints.
