{"dml":"Matching methods become inefficient in high-dimensional settings. ML-based methods are better at handling many confounders while reducing bias. DML leverages machine learning to estimate treatment effects. It works well in high-dimensional settings with large datasets.",
"drl":"Matching methods become inefficient in high-dimensional settings. ML-based methods are better at handling many confounders while reducing bias.  DRL combines propensity score modeling (IPW) and outcome regression, making it robust even if one model is misspecified. It's more stable with small sample sizes than DML.",
"cem":"When the number of confounders is small, exact or approximate matching is effective in balancing covariates. CEM ensures exact matching on coarsened categorical variables, which can reduce bias and keeps variance low. By controlling confounders with CEM, we can make causal inference more credible.",
"propensity_score":"When the number of confounders is small, exact or approximate matching is effective in balancing covariates. PSM estimates treatment probability and matches treated and control units. It's better for continuous variables. By controlling confounders with PSM, we can make causal inference more credible.",
"iv":"IV methods handle unobserved confounders by using an external variable (IV) that affects treatment but not the outcome directly. With Instrumental Variable we can remove endogenous bias, making causal inference more credible."}
